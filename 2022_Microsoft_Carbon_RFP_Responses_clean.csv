A2E Solutions LLC,Yes,7 MEGATON ROFO ON NOVEL DAC CARBON REMOVAL PROJECT,AIR TO EARTH CARBON REMOVAL OFFSETS,Direct air capture and storage</span,,,,"A2E SOLUTIONS LLC ( We � or  AIR TO EARTHÂ® �) offers MICROSOFT CORPORATION ( MSFT �) (i) the opportunity to measurably, additionally and permanently decarbonize the NYISO, ISO New  England and PJM power grids by removing 7 million metric tons of carbon pollutions rights from these grids and (ii) a right of first offer ( ROFO �) to enter into 7 million metric ton net carbon removal offtake agreement from direct air capture ( DAC �) and storage projects our affiliates are developing. 

Pollution rights removal bring about power grid decarbonization by reducing supply from the most carbon intensive generators.  Voluntary renewable PPAs add supply to the grid and displace the least economic generation units and their associated carbon.  Either approach works, however, rights removal is a significantly less expensive way to decarbonize these grids today. 

We will issue, register and retire 7 million tons of AIR TO EARTHÂ® Carbon Removal Offsets ( A2E CROs �) on MSFT s behalf in FY22, backed by carbon pollution rights irrevocably removed from use under a regulatory framework validated by 11 States and the EPA.  A portion of MSFT s payment for A2E CROs would accelerate DAC technology innovation and develop DAC and natural carbon removal projects.  

In summary, AIR TO EARTHÂ® believes a multi-faceted approach to carbon removal is the best way to reach global climate goals and is doing so through three pillars:

Pollution Rights Removal

A2E CROs leverage the  cap and invest � Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ( RGGI �) regulations.  AIR TO EARTHÂ® would irrevocably transfer pollution rights to a national conservation non-profit organization to assure they are never used by fossil polluters.  MSFT can elect to apply A2E CROs against current and/or future period Scope 2 and/or Scope 1 and 3 net-zero emissions goals while accelerating carbon removal project development. 

DAC Project Development

Our affiliate A2E LLC is collaborating with Texas A&M Energy Institute to develop new materials to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  The collaboration will leverage (i) Texas A&M s experience with porous polymer network chemical sorbents and (ii) our affiliates  intellectual property related to novel DAC facility designs.  A2E LLC funded the first year of this multi-year project; proceeds from MSFT s A2E CROs would fund development of a pilot-scale demonstration and site control for full-scale projects. 

Natural Carbon Removal 

Proceeds from MSFT s A2E CROs also would fund Kiss the Ground s and Restore America s Estuaries  capacity to potentially develop regenerative agriculture and coastal blue carbon removal projects, per agreements with us.

OTHER ORGANIZATIONS:

The following organization provide foundational support to the three pillars of our multi-faceted approach to remove carbon and deliver environmental and social benefits:

RGGI States

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ( RGGI �) is a cooperative effort among eleven states  “ Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia  “ to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Through statutes or regulations based on the RGGI model rule, each state has established individual CO2 budget trading programs based upon its own statutory or regulatory authority. Together, these compose a regional cap and market for allowances. Each state's CO2 budget trading programs limits emissions of CO2 from electric power plants, issues CO2 allowances (which we refer to as  pollution rights � in this response) and establishes participation in regional CO2 allowance auctions.  States use pollution rights sales proceeds to fund clean energy investment and other greenhouse gas reduction programs to provide substantial benefits to energy consumers and the environment.

Additional detail on each RGGI state s statutory and regulatory authority can be found here:
https://www.rggi.org/program-overview-and-design/state-regulations

RGGI, Inc. 

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, Inc. ( RGGI, Inc. �) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation created to support development and implementation of RGGI.   RGGI, Inc.'s exclusive purpose is to provide administrative and technical services to support the development and implementation of each RGGI state's CO2 budget trading program.  

Additional detail on RGGI, Inc. can be found here: 
https://www.rggi.org/rggi-inc/contact

RGGI, Inc. Board of Directors

The Board of Directors of RGGI, Inc. is composed of agency heads of energy and environmental regulatory agencies in each RGGI state.

Additional detail on the RGGI Board of Directors can be found here: 
https://www.rggi.org/rggi-inc/board-of-directors

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

Under each RGGI state s CO2 budget trading programs, each  CO2 budget source � (i.e., a fossil fuel power plant greater than 25 MW in size in most RGGI states) is required to hold one CO2 allowance for each ton of CO2 emitted during the preceding three-year control period. The fifth three-year control period began on January 1, 2021.  Each state leverages measuring and reporting obligations that  CO2 budget sources � have under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Markets Division Business System, which is integrated with RGGI CO2 Allowance Tracking System ( COATS �).

EEPB 

EEPB is a professional services company who performs accounting services for AIR TO EARTHÂ® and affiliates and is available upon request to perform ""agreed upon procedures � to audit and certify for MSFT that A2E CROs are measurable and backed by RGGI pollution rights.

Texas A&M Energy Institute

As part of its recently announced collaboration with AIR TO EARTHÂ®, Texas A&M Energy Institute will modify or design new state-of-the-art materials, called chemical sorbents, which will ideally be able to be produced at low costs, provide durable performance, and efficiently capture carbon dioxide from ambient air. Focusing on porous polymer networks (""PPNs""), which show great promise for the technological feasibility and driving down the costs of DAC, the project will seek to optimize the materials, processes, and technologies that will eventually lead to an efficient, cost-effective full-scale DAC operation. 

The team from the Texas A&M Energy Institute will be led by Stratos Pistikopoulos, the director of the Texas A&M Energy Institute and a professor of chemical engineering. Pistikopoulos is an expert in the modeling, simulation, and optimization of chemical and energy processes, with an emphasis on sustainable innovative energy solutions, process intensification, and smart manufacturing. Three additional Texas A&M professors bring diverse and extensive experience:

Mukul Bhatia, an executive professor of geology and geophysics, the director of the Berg-Hughes Center for Petroleum and Sedimentary Systems, and the Dan A. Hughes '51 Chair.
Faruque Hasan, an associate professor of chemical engineering.
Hongcai ""Joe"" Zhou, a professor of chemistry and the Robert A. Welch Foundation Chair.

","In late 2019, Joseph Stark, the founder and CEO of Air to Earth LLC, became aware of the critical importance of the need for carbon removal to have any chance for our planet to come under the 1.5C warming path under the Paris Agreement.  As a petroleum engineer and project financier with significant energy investment and tax credit transactional experience, Joe initially began focusing on potential carbon sequestration sites in the U.S. and Class VI injection well permitting requirements given his experience and skill set.   He then began focusing on atmospheric carbon dioxide removal by direct air capture, after learning of a potential $250/ton revenue model that was available with Section 45Q tax credits and California LCFS credits.   His initial approach relied on identifying a well capitalized project participant to guarantee project technology performance to facilitate a project financing.  When one did not surface, Joe investigated the many technical facets underpinning the field of direct air capture, together with various energy supply options available to maximizing net capture and concluded, although in its early stage, the field looked promising.  From there, he engaged engineers to design a novel full scale, hydraulically efficient air capture facility for optimizing the advection of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the contact and capture of carbon dioxide by a sorbent and removal of carbon dioxide from a sorbent for utilization or sequestration.  

As sole funder of Air to Earth LLC and given the long lead time for direct air capture project development, Joe began focusing on a more immediate carbon revenue business models as a way to fund direct air capture project development.  In late 2020, Joe and Richard Tassone, Founding Member and Executive Creative Director of Air to Earth LLC, developed the multi-faceted carbon removal approach described in this RFP response, targeting individuals, corporations and governmental institutions. They launched airtoearth.com in March 2021, a consumer facing website and began targeting corporations, governments individuals about achieving net zero goals with A2E CROs backed by pollution rights removal.  Please refer to our website for additional information about A2E CROs and AIR TO EARTHÂ®.

Pollution rights removal bring about power grid decarbonization by reducing supply from the most carbon intensive generators.  Voluntary renewable PPAs add supply to the grid and displace the least economic generation units and their associated carbon.  Either approach works, however, rights removal is a significantly less expensive way to decarbonize these grids today.  

A2E CROs backed by pollution rights removal are measurable and avoid emissions is an additional and permanent manner equal to the tonnage stated on the uniquely identifiable pollution rights issued by the RGGI States.

To the extent we offer MSFT an offtake agreement on a direct air capture ( DAC �) and storage project under development by our affiliates and MSFT accepts our offer under its right of first offer ( ROFO �),  MSFT would remove carbon from the atmosphere over the project term that would match MSFT's contracted quantity of A2E CROs backed by pollution rights.  

We would issue A2E CROs backed by the ROFO DAC Project and remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere, the quantity so removed would be metered at the Class VI injection wellhead on a real time basis along with other operating data.

The RGGI pollution rights removal project is registered as A2E/CRO/RIGHTS/US/RGGI.  We are in discussions with with third parties about an endorsement / wrap of A2E CROs backed by this project.",,,Yes,,"Project Risks	

As described, AIR TO EARTHÂ® focuses on three pillars: pollution rights removal, direct air capture technology innovation and natural carbon removal.  

Pollution Rights Removal 

The primary risk of pollution rights removal is the quantity to be won at auction. We view this risk as low and anticipate that over three auctions, we can successfully deliver the contacted quantity of avoided emissions to MSFT represented by A2E CROs backed by pollutions rights removal based on market prices.  

The quantity of pollution rights or emission allowances we acquire at an auction is known as the  Cleared Quantity � for such Auction. Our auction success is based on how the bids we submit to the auction manager compare to the auction clearing price ( Cleared Price �). We anticipate submitting multiple bids of varying quantities and prices in a manner that meets the requirement to provide the auction manager financial security for the bids we submit. Our bid strategy is confidential; we will not share with you this information nor any information related to our bids (e.g., quantities, prices). For bids submitted at a price that is higher than the Cleared Price for an auction, those bids win CO2 allowances at the Cleared Price and are awarded CO2 allowances in an aggregate quantity equal to the Cleared Quantity. The cost of these awarded CO2 allowances is known as the  Cleared Amount � for such auction and is determined by multiplying the Cleared Quantity for such auction by the Cleared Price for such Auction. The auction manager deducts the Cleared Amount from the financial security we provided and returns to us any unused excess portion of such financial security.  

Direct Air Capture Technology Innovation

A portion of MSFT s payment for A2E CROs would accelerate technology innovation of direct air capture and development of a DAC carbon removal project.  Our research agreement with Texas A&M Energy Institute is focused on basic research and as such, there is a risk that results needed to justify taking the project to the pilot-stage demonstration may not materialize or be delayed.  Dedicated funding from MSFT s payment for A2E CRO would mitigate this technology risk by funding a contingency research reserve account, but at the expense of delayed timing for the demonstration project.  Obtaining long term operational data from any demonstration project for use and to justify proceeding with a full-scale project is also a material risk for the ROFO and will not be known until such a demonstration project is operational. 

A portion of MSFT s payment would be used to secure site-control for a large-scale project.  We have identified a few sites with ideal characteristics for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide.  Our ability to lock up such a site is subject to availability and market forces. We believe due to an abundance of quality sites with ideal characteristics, this risk should be low. 


Natural Carbon Removal

A portion of MSFT s payment for A2E CROs would be used to develop natural carbon removal projects. There is no guarantee that the funding we provide our non-profit partners will result in any supply of natural carbon removal projects.  We will monitor their progress and adjust their involvement in our multi-faceted approach to carbon removal based on performance. 

",10000,10000,"Permanent geologic sequestration of captured carbon dioxide from any AIR TO EARTHÂ® direct air capture and storage project is a highly regulated affair.  What is most disruptive about DAC, as opposed to organizing a carbon sequestration project around a post combustion point source of carbon dioxide, is atmospheric carbon dioxide removal by DAC can occur practically anywhere.  We have identified a site that has the following attributes: best in class geology (capable of storing 25 million tons per section), large land owners, no active oil and gas wells in the area (each of course is a potential leak path), significant green power supply on the grid, access to natural gas and other infrastructure and proximity to post combustion CO2 sources to potentially amortize down the costs of developing a gigaton storage complex.   

As you know, captured carbon dioxide that is compressed into a super critical fluid has high mobility due to extremely high relative permeability under pressure drop and buoyancy.  The permitting process under Class VI is regulated by the EPA in all but one state (i.e. North Dakota) and requires significant up front investment to qualify the storage complex, the particular storage zone, the sealing mechanism of such zone, injection well construction plan and the monitoring and measuring protocol of pressure, rate and injection fronts as determined by 3-D seismic and monitoring wells.  We are fans of how the North Dakota Industry Commission established its regulations although we anticipate interfacing with the EPA in targeted jurisdictions. We prefer Class VI injection well storage in saline aquifers versus Class II injection well storage in practically depleted oil fields because of reduced risk of physical reversal, better optics and additional stringency of the Class VI underground injection control (UIC) permit process.   

As a condition precedent to receiving any Class VI injection permit, any AIR TO EARTHÂ® direct air capture and storage project would need to provide financial security to cover the costs of: corrective action, emergency and remedial response, injection well plugging, and post-injection site care and site closure.  We envision these funds would be part of the initial project costs, placed in a trust and available to the trustee for payment to fund corrective action, emergency and remedial response, injection well plugging and post-injection site care and site closure as directed by the EPA, and will be available to collateralize the developer's guarantee obligation to MSFT until such funds are no longer required and can be released to developer, as directed by the EPA. ","We will keep MSFT aware of any reportable deviations related to reversal as set for in our offset contract with you.  Reversal monitoring will be achieved pursuant to testing and monitoring in accordance with 40 CFR 146.89, 146.90, and 146.91 to verify that the CO2 storage site is operating as permitted and is not endangering any USDWs. Elements of this include hydraulic, geophysical, and geochemical components for characterizing the complex fate and transport processes associated with CO2 injection.  The injection and monitoring wells within or above the target injection zone will be monitored for the duration of the project to characterize pressure and CO2 transport response and guide operational and regulatory decision-making. These monitoring results, along with those from a deep early-detection monitoring well installed to just above the primary confining zone, will likely provide the first indication of any unanticipated containment loss.  More on reversal monitoring, verification and accounting will be contained in any Class VI injection permit application and our offset agreement with MSFT.","When sailing, the most important decision is whether or not to leave the port on a bad weather day.  Similarly, only those storage sites that have a well understood and low risk Area of Review would be considered as a possible sequestration site.  The amount of financial security required to receive a Class VI injection permit is indicative of the Area of Review and Site Characterization risk.   As an example, to the extent a containment leak path were to develop in connection with a previously abandoned wellbore penetration in the Area of Review, corrective action would be taken to re-plug such well using funds on deposit in the trust account.  Other ways to mitigate reversal risk would be to modify operating injection rates and pressures to remedy the situation.  ","With regard to avoided carbon of A2E CROs backed by pollution rights removal, we don't see any reversal risk considering our lock-up structure that prevents these rights from ever being used.  We would be party to a third party beneficiary agreement under this structure and could include MSFT as a third party beneficiary. 

With regard to removed carbon of A2E CROs backed by MSFT's ROFO on net carbon removal from direct air capture and storage, we would be willing to arrange environmental insurance policies that could provide in effect ""business interruption compensation payment"" triggered by a property loss claim.  Such risk reduction mechanism would be subject to negotiation with insurers and the cost of such policy would be added to the offtake agreement price per ton.

We could also arrange a buffer pool into the offtake contract to overcollateralize this risk for MSFT, but at the cost of a higher offtake price. ",We are happy to discuss these requirements with MSFT in due diligence and can agree to broad indicative terms that could be included in any offtake agreement that would be the subject of the ROFO that we would grant MSFT.,To be discussed.,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Our ideal outcome is for (X) MSFT to agree to purchase 7 million tons of A2E CROs backed by pollution rights removal in RGGI in FY22, which would provide resources for affiliates of AIR TO EARTHÂ® to innovate DAC technology and develop a direct air capture and storage project under the ROFO we grant you, so that (Y) MSFT can start taking delivery of 7 million tons of A2E CROs in FY25 backed by net carbon removal from the direct air capture and storage project we develop for you under the ROFO.  In addition, such FY22 order would provide resource for our nature based partners to potentially develop carbon removal projects which may be of interest to MSFT in the future, and to more broadly advance the field of nature based carbon removal. 

The FY22 sale of A2E CROs backed by RGGI pollutions rights removal would provide MSFT with measurable, additional and permanent avoided emissions, which could: 

(i) decarbonize your current and future period Scope 2 emissions in NYISO, ISO New England or PJM; 
(ii) decarbonize your current and future period Scope 2 emissions on other grids; 
(iii) decarbonize your current or future period Scope 1 and 3 emissions and/or;
(iv) generate financial returns (i.e., of the  7 million tons of A2E CROs issued, registered and retired on MSFT's behalf at current market prices that are not applied to net zero goals during MSFT's holding period, you could elect to resale any unused portion to a third party with no moral hazard of reintroducing the underlying pollution rights back onto the RGGI market).  

As to A2E CROs backed by net carbon removal from a direct air capture and storage project we develop for you under the ROFO, we seek at least a 12 year contract term to maximize Section 45Q tax credit monetization proceeds and a minimum and maximum net removal amount of 100,000 to 1 million tons per annum starting in FY25.",Pricing for A2E CROs backed by net carbon removal from a direct air capture and storage project we develop for you under the ROFO is subject to collection of pilot-scale demonstration data and specific full-scale project specific data.  We look forward to firming up cost estimates to discuss offtake pricing levels in FY24.,,,,,"A2E CROs backed by RGGI Pollution Rights are auctioned by RGGI States.  Since the program s inception in 2008, RGGI States have raised and used $4.0 billion of auction proceeds to fund energy efficiency, clean and renewable energy projects, greenhouse gas abatement and direct bill assistance. The carbon reduction of these investments is not quantified directly by us in this RFP response.

","Yes, through targeted investment of RGGI auction proceeds in disadvantaged communities as described above. ","A2E CROs backed by pollutions rights removal would increase the price of carbon, which would results in a higher price of fossil grid power.

Accend AS,Yes,Net negative Construction in the Nordics verified by Puro Methodology,Nordic Wood,Other (please specify),,Sustainable forestry and carbon storage in construction elements.,," Nordic Wood � is a forestry and engineered timber project. Coniferous forest land in Norway and Sweden is managed in accordance with PEFC certificates ensuring carbon neutrality and sustainability. Timber is harvested and using modern technology engineered into in large scale, made to measure, massive-wood elements for commercial building construction. 
CDR is achieved through the storage of the carbon in the timber elements that will be kept out of the atmosphere +/- 100 years. All emissions from harvesting, transport and production are subtracted from the carbon stored in the timber, the result is the net tonnage of CDR. Each m3 of timber can be traced to a forest and to the place of long-term storage in a building.
The project participants are four timber companies who make made to measure, cross-laminated timber, glulam and structural elements, Moleven, TEWO, Splitkon and Are. The forestry is carried out by the selection of land managers in Sweden and Norway.
A project activity is additional if it can be demonstrated that the activity results in emission reductions or removals that are in excess of what would be achieved under a  business-as-usual � scenario and the activity would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive provided by the carbon markets. Nordic Wood is additional. Whilst building small houses in Norway from wood is nothing new, the baseline scenario for commercial buildings in Norway and Sweden is the use of reinforced concrete elements which have a heavy footprint. The current market penetration for load-bearing massive-wood elements is currently 3.7%, the rest concrete. Under the Verra activity penetration threshold of 5%, all wooden elements of this type are additional. 

Financial additionality: whilst wooden elements are preferred by early adopters, especially schools, they are at a cost disadvantage to concrete. Carbon financing will help to make wooden elements more cost-competitive and thereby increase their uptake.

The CDR is certified against the Puro.Earth methodology. CORCs are issued ex-post after 3rd party verification by DNV GL. The project methodology is 100% removals but also results in a significant avoidance of emissions as loading bearing elements such as CLT have a net negative footprint of 550 kg CO2e/m3 compared to a footprint of 200-500 kg CO2e/m3 for re-enforced concrete.

The company operates 2 veneer plants, a veneer drying facility, plywood plant, cogeneration facility, a stud mill, their own log and highway trucks, and the MPP production facility located in Lyons, Oregon on the westside of the Cascade Mountains. 

The co-generation facility is a 100% biomass-fired rotary bed boiler that runs 24/7 producing steam to use in the manufacturing of lumber-based products and for electricity generation. The biochar is a by-product of steam production. The boiler is fed with a wide range of biomass feedstocks sourced from the local region, including bark and waste from the on-site production of timber products. The char is either shipped to a landfill, where it becomes a carbon sink or is used for material purposes. The company has plans to produce soil amendments by combing biochar. 

The production of biochar by Freres Lumber is performed in accordance with the eligibility requirements for the Puro biochar methodology. The feedstock comes from multiple sources: 62% of the feedstock is waste wood such as pallet grindings, ply trim and sawdust. 10% is agricultural waste, 0,3% is food processing residues, and 28% forestry residues (Bark) from Freres  own operations. The carbon content of the biochar is 81,1% in the dry state. The stability of the carbon content can be ascertained using the molar O/C org ratio. The maximum oxygen content was calculated by excluding other elements, and the maximum molar O/C ratio of 0.09 determined.
","The project s management structure is as follows:  Freres Lumber is the owner of the project.  ACT Commodities is the project developer and marketer.  We are involved in the development of all the technical aspects of the LCA making sure the credits are properly verified and accounted for, and also work in marketing/selling these credits on behalf of Freres.

In the case of Freres Biochar, the exact carbon removal number is 2.89 MT per dry ton of Biochar. This is also thanks to its permanence.

For the same reason reversals are not expected in our project, because the verifier checks that the biochar is not shipped to combustive use. 

-	The durable storage of biochar and the carbon dioxide embodied in it can be estimated with the O:C ration received from the laboratory test. In general, a molar ratio of O:C lower than 0.2 appears to provide, at minimum, a 1000-year biochar half-life. There is a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010), which allows to calculate a duration over which 90% of carbon in the biochar remains. The O:C ratio measured in our biochar is 0.021.    Puro methodologies always contain a buffer that covers premature reversals of carbon removal. In the biochar methodology the buffer is currently between 2,5 -5% reflecting the scientifically measured quality of the biochar i.e. the O:C ratio.    

-	We only offer removals that already have been performed (ex-post).    We only sell biochar to users in the horticultural and landscaping sector, to make sure it ultimately ends up in arable topsoils. We also use the biochar to provide environmental services (phosphorous, nitrogen removal), and then recycle the loaded biochar into horticulture. We do not offer our own biochar as fuel for power plants or reducing agent for the metal industry.  
","-	Provided that biochar made from waste or residual biomass is dispersed in an environment where it will decay at least ten-times slower than it would as the feedstock it was made from, the carbon storage in biochar displays high durability (Campbell et al. 2018). To ensure this, we have a direct relationship with our customers, and we know how they are using the product. The low amounts of volatiles and the fact that our biochar is extremely durable, makes it undesirable for energy use or burning. We test our biochar regularly to make sure it conforms to eligibility requirements of Puro.earth biochar methodology and the EBC (European Biochar Certificate). With every change to the system size, time, feedstock or location we will be doing new independent laboratory analysis that will give us these numbers. Reference: Campbell, J. L., Sessions, J., Smith, D., & Trippe, K. (2018). Potential carbon storage in biochar made from logging residue: Basic principles and Southern Oregon case studies. PloS one, 13(9), e0203475.","-	Puro.earth standard (Annex A 1.1.12) requires safe handling and transport of biochar to prevent fire and dust hazards. Compliance to that requirement is assured by the third-party independent auditor by verifying the Material Safety Data Sheet or a laboratory test results from UN test N.4. Also, the logistics companies will not accept the biochar without the Safety Data Sheet and right level of moisture. It is also in the users  interest to make sure all the valuable biochar is placed in the soil media.

-	We keep record the customers we have delivered biochar to and for what purpose. Puro.earth methodology (Annex A 1.1.1) prohibits shipping of biochar for energy uses. Compliance to that requirement is assured by the third-party independent auditor by verifying the sales contracts or shipping documents. There is also an  economic guarantee �, i.e. the price of biochar is manifold compared to biofuel or metallurgical coke and so it is simply too expensive for energy use. The price level effectively hinders burning and all the other uses of biochar are keeping the carbon sequestered. In addition to that, we do visit the users of biochar to be able follow the co-benefits of the biochar in the respective use.
","Puro.earth has a buffer pool as part of its verification process.  This will account for any leakages/reversals in the process. All CORCs are issued ex-post, which minimizes the risks for Microsoft. Additionally, based on literature leakage is not an issue. The conversion of logging residues, and other similar waste materials, into biochar does not create a market incentive to release carbon elsewhere, rendering leakage negative (Campbell et al. 2018).

Freres will continue with its Biochar production, and we will account for it on a bi-monthly basis.  We could reach an agreement where Microsoft buys the bi-monthly production of these CORCs, and therefore guarantee a steady supply and price for years to come.","We would be interested in a 1 year offtake agreement with the possibility of extending it to more years (3-5 years), which would be dependent on us negotiating an extension with Freres Lumber.

These can be found with simple research on the benefits of Biochar.  Once Biochar has reached a Carbon Content greater than 60% it is accurate to say that these co-benefits apply.  It is very important to verify that the Biochar is of high quality, which if it is, will encompass all of these co-benefits.

Agoro Carbon Alliance,Yes,Implementation of farm practices to increase soil organic carbon,GS - Agoro Carbon Sustainable Agriculture PoA in USA,Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"Introduction

As a newly launched company, we are currently developing our first soil carbon project in the U.S.. The first states in which we are implementing the project activities are: Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, Washington, and North Dakota. This is a Programme of Activities (PoA), meaning that many farms will be aggregated under one project. We are following the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) Framework under the Gold Standard for the Global Goals. Agoro Carbon submitted new methodologies under the SOC Framework to increase the activities that can sequester carbon. We have also pioneered a measurement protocol where sampling stratification ensures accurate and representative measurement of sequestered SOC, while providing advantages in terms of cost and efficiency to enable project scale-up.

How Our Project Will Deliver CDRs

By working with farmers to implement reduced tillage, no-tillage, and cover crops, carbon is removed from the air and stored in soil through increased crop residue and cover crop biomass returning to the soil. Additional carbon is also stored in the soil by reduced soil disturbance, such as no-tillage and reduced tillage.

A physical soil sampling campaign, and consequent lab analyses of the samples will allow the quantification of soil organic carbon stocks at baseline and verification time.
Third-party verification will be conducted, in line with the Gold Standard requirements.
Once the Gold Standard issues the CDRs, Agoro Carbon will deliver them to Microsoft.

History of the Project

This project is at the beginning of its history. Driven by the recognition that agriculture accounts for 10-12% of global emissions, Yara International launched Agoro Carbon Alliance in 2021. Since then, the team has grown to over 70 people, and enrolled tens of thousands of acres in the United States for our pilot project. Teams in Brazil, Europe, and India are now beginning to develop similar projects.

Major Participants

The major participants are:
-  the farmers themselves, who will be responsible for implementing the new practices;
- Agoro Carbon Alliance, as the carbon project developer and funding entity to enable project implementation.

How Microsoft s Payments for CDRs Will Be Used

Microsoft s payments for CDRs will be used to reward the farmers for the implementation of practices under the PoA and to finance further  R&D of cutting-edge remote sensing technology to improve MRV systems for quantification and monitoring of carbon. 

Land Use and Ownership History

The land on which the project takes place has been farmland for at least over ten years, as required by the applied Gold Standard methodology.

The ownership history varies according to the farm. Generally, the farms are either family-owned, or rented from other farmers.
","Overview of the Project s Governance Structure

The structure of this project starts with the farmers, who are implementing regenerative agriculture practices in consultation with Agoro Carbon s agronomists. The agronomists then report to a Global Agronomist, who determines which practices to implement for maximum sequestration.

Two managers focus on the project design and documentation to ensure the project follows the Gold Standard methodology. 

A soil data team focuses on the sampling campaign, including the stratification approach and contracting laboratories to quantify the carbon sequestered in soil samples.

A managing director is ultimately responsible for this project.

All Organizations Involved in Project Design and Implementation  “ Roles and Responsibilities

Besides the above-mentioned farmers, validation/verification bodies will conduct verification of the CDRs, in accordance with the Gold Standard Requirements. Laboratories will be contracted to test samples for carbon content.We do not anticipate other organizations being involved.

Overview of Management s Capacity to Secure All Planned Carbon, Environmental, and Social Benefits

Agoro Carbon has a strong management team specialized in carbon credit development, building and launching agricultural companies, and soil health knowledge. In addition, Agoro Carbon plans to leverage Yara's R&D and agricultural know-how in order to develop the best possible projects for farmers.
","Agoro Carbon Alliance began this project in 2021, as the first of many to come. 
A cover-cropping and a zero-tillage module under the SOC Framework was submitted to the Gold Standard in 2021, and we expect approval later this year.

Financing of the project comes from Yara International. ",11/1/2021,N/A,"Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, Washington, North Dakota",United States,0,0,Yes,0,0,252000,252000,0,0,0,0,264600,264600,0,0,0,0,352800,352800,,,,,,,,,,,100,100,N/A,No,No certification,,N/A,"We intend to develop a project under the Gold Standard. Certification will be completed, and we are not at that stage yet.","Monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) are essential elements of climate and development initiatives, ensuring that project claims are accurate and real. As per the Gold Standard rules and requirements, Agoro Carbon will appoint a Validation/Verification body (VVB) to independently verify the carbon sequestration. ",Yes,,"We have identified the following risks related to the implementation of our project:
1.	Delivery risk - related to non-compliance of some farmers with the specific requirements and/or methodologies of the Gold Standard (GS) related to the Program.

In order to mitigate this risk, we have established contractual relationship with farmers with the obligations of the farmer to meet certain Gold Standard requirements related to specific practice(s) such as maintenance of cropping systems, management practices and yield on the fields included in the project. We will also establish a comprehensive monitoring system for the project, where we will collect and analyze information to document the impacts of the practices on soil carbon sequestration, GHG emissions, environmental impacts, and any other information as required. 

2.	Withdrawal risk -  A shortage of credits to be delivered to the buyer might arise during the crediting period if some farmers withdraw from the project. 

We intend to mitigate this as follows:
-	If needed, use credits from other similar projects developed by Agoro Carbon (e.g. in India or Brazil); and
-	Implement necessary changes in this process and/or if needed, to project design, to bring the project back on track.
Should any shortage arise, we will consult and agree with Microsoft on the most appropriate credits shortage compensation mechanism.


3.	Risks of Natural Disturbance
If natural disturbances occur - such as pest and disease outbreaks, droughts, etc. - these might impact the yield, crops and soil carbon stock of the farmers enrolled in the project. 

To mitigate this risk, soil carbon stock of the fields enrolled in the project will be regularly monitored. Any impacts from natural disturbances on soil carbon stock levels and associated crediting will be accounted for during the monitoring phase of the project.
",10,10,"Durability term is determined by the Gold Standard methodology. 

Physical reversals are compensated by replacing lost CDRs with CDRs from another project, or through discounting at subsequent issuance.","The project monitors for reversals as part of the MRV plan, which includes sampling of fields and consequent laboratory testing. If a reversal occurs, Agoro Carbon will alert buyers by email within 3 business days of the information being known.","Avoidable risks stem from the human behavior aspect of this project: farmers may withdraw from the project and recommence conventional tillage or not planting cover crops. These risks are mitigated with contracts signed between Agoro Carbon and participating farmers. 

Unavoidable risks stem from the natural context of the project: extreme weather events  “ such as drought or flood  “ may result in the sequestered carbon being released into the atmosphere. These risks are mitigated using buffer pools, per the Gold Standard methodology.
","In the case of an avoidable reversal, Agoro Carbon will compensate Microsoft with equivalent CDRs.

In the case of an unavoidable reversal, Gold Standard VERs will be retired from the buffer pool.",The Gold Standard buffer pool is on a project basis and is not intermixed with credits from other projects.,"20% of the credits are put into the buffer pool, per the Gold Standard methodology.",Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"Ideal outcome from this proposal

Recognizing that Agoro Carbon has not issued credits to date, the ideal outcome from this proposal would be an agreement for Microsoft to offtake credits generated from this project over the next 10 years.

What sort of multi-year contract?

We are seeking a forward contract for delivery upon issuance in 2024, 2027, and 2030. We are comfortable with significant optionality regarding contract terms.

Minimum and maximum volumes 

Minimum Volume: 10,000 tons
Maximum Volume: 869,400 tons

Length of tenure

The offtake agreement can last for the project s crediting period of ten years.

Timeline to arrange offtake

We can arrange the offtake within one month.
",N/A,"Carbon sequestration will be quantified by measuring the soil organic carbon prior to project implementation and monitored during the 10 year crediting period. The baseline consists of two types of information, namely farm data on historical practices and the baseline soil organic carbon stock estimate of the project.

Here is how we gather/generate such information:
a)	Our growers are based in the US, across multiple states. Project scenarios encompass the implementation of unique or a mix of sustainable practices, including cover crops and reduced or no-tillage. Detailed information on historical (5-year track record) management practices, such as crop rotation, was collected on a per-field basis through phone interviews and digital data sharing with every individual grower. Field boundaries were either uploaded as existing shapefiles, or drawn by the grower directly into our digital platform. 

b)	In line with the Soil Organic Carbon Framework methodology requirements to follow a stratified approach, Agoro Carbon's modelling experts have pioneered a two-stage stratification protocol where the sampling design ensures that each modelling unit is sampled while providing advantages in terms of cost and efficiency to enable project scale-up. The implementation of the stratification follows approaches such as clustering on covariates that have been described in peer-reviewed scientific papers (Viscarra Rossel, et al., 2016; de Gruijter, et al.,). Validation of the stratification is done at each step using scores, metrics as well as estimation of mean and variances (inter and intra strata) from predicted soil organic carbon stock data.

This physical sampling approach will be continued throughout the monitoring period. This approach gives the most accurate estimates of organic carbon stocks, and leads to the absence of carbon credit deduction for our programs.

The projects present Microsoft with a unique opportunity to directly invest projects that are (1) in need of carbon finance to scale restoration efforts, (2) will provide significant volumes of carbon removals, and (3) directly involve the local communities in the restoration work. The project areas are located in four different Mexican states: Alvarado, Campeche, Nayarit and Quintana Roo and at the conclusion of the projects more than 35,000 hectares (86,5000 acres) of mangroves will have been restored and more than 31 Million tons of CO2e removed over 30 years. BlueMX Mangrove A.C is the project developer, is exclusively focused on developing these projects, and the project team includes carbon project and market experts, as well as mangrove specialists with a long history of working in the project areas. The team is located close to the sites and is working in close collaboration with local communities ( ejidos ), landowners, and government agencies. THe projects are being registered as Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) projects under VCS and the specific project activity referenced in the Project Design Document is Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR). In addition to the restoration activities the project team has also secured the conservation of significant areas of mangrove forest in the same areas. These conservation activities will be registered with Verra separately as individual REDD+ projects.
The restoration sites are located in three different ecosystems: 1) the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico, 2) the Central Mexico Pacific coast, and 3) the Caribbean coastline on the Yucatan Peninsula. The marshy and wetland ecosystems constitute one of the most important coastal ecological units in Mesoamerica due to their natural productivity and biodiversity. The region has recently experienced a significant increase in the removal and destruction of mangroves through conversion to other uses, including industry and agricultural purposes (primarily palm oil), Aquaculture (shrimp farming), and as a result of local infrastructure development, such as road and bridge construction. 
Blue Carbon Projects MX (BCMX) is working with local communities ( ejidos ) and government agencies to secure the conservation of mangrove and restore mangrove through tree planting and restoring hydrological flows. The majority of the work to seed, grow, and plant the mangroves, as well as restore the hydrology and sediments will be done by local communities providing jobs to regions generally suffering from lack of job opportunities and significant poverty. In addition, the local communities will receive a share of the funds raised from the carbon market. (Note PDD is being submitted to Verra and can be shared when project is listed).

","After being part of the team that successfully developed the Rimba Raya Conservation and Restoration project in Indonesia Joseph L Garcia Falmer returned to his native Mexico to develop Blue Carbon projects. He connected with local mangrove experts and community organizations and introduced how carbon finance can support restoration efforts that have traditionally suffered from lack of funds and resources. BlueMX has signed agreements with the local communities and landowners to develop the carbon projects. Unfortunately the execution of these agreements was significantly delayed due to the corona pandemic as many communities ( ejidos) require in-person meetings to agree to such agreements. However, we have now secured these agreements for the referenced 35,000 hectares of restoration.

We are not requiring a certain contract length for the prices listed in the RFP.,"Baseline Removals
Project accounting for ARR activities includes comparing the monitored project scenario changes in carbon stocks. The Methodology requires the consideration of GHG removals in the baseline scenario. In most cases, these removals are expected to be small. However, to calculate the net GHG removals under the ARR baseline scenario we use: 

âˆ†CBSL-ARR=t=1t*âˆ†CBSL,t+âˆ†CBSL-herb
Where: 
= Net GHG removals under the ARR baseline scenario up to time t*(t CO2e)
= Baseline net GHG removals by sinks in year t (from AR-ACM0003) (t CO2e)
= Net GHG removals under the ARR baseline scenario in herbaceous vegetation up to time t* (t CO2e)
= 1,2,3  ¦ t* time since project start (years)

Project Removals
Net GHG removals are estimated as the change in carbon stocks in the project within the selected carbon pools. There are three primary carbon pools that will be carbon sinks in the project scenario and are considered for our projects. The first two are aboveground and below ground biomass. We consider these as one biomass pool, as below ground biomass is rarely measured separately from aboveground biomass but is instead derived as a proportion of aboveground biomass using a root-to-shoot ratio. The third pool is the soil carbon pool, as reforested and restored mangrove areas become net carbon sinks due to the sequestration and storage of carbon within this pool.

Biomass Removals
Understanding biomass removals is a relatively straightforward process. Estimating these removals is dependent on measurements of average annual growth, planting density and observed mortality.

Soil Carbon Removals
The implementation of reforestation and wetland restoration activities achieves immediate sequestration within the soil carbon pool following the establishment of vegetation. Our measurements at project sites have indicated sequestration rates as high as 6.5tC ha(-1).

Estimating total project removals requires the combination of the planting schedule, biomass, and soil carbon removals. Net emission removals are calculated as the difference of carbon stocks in the baseline and project scenario.

Carbofex Oy,,Demonstration and commercialisation of biochar based CDR,Carbofex Oy,Other (specify),"PyCCS, Biomass conversion with pyrolysis to stabile storage in biochar",,,"Sampo Tukiainen has been researching and developing pyrolysis technology for two decades. One of the most important aspects of his work has been the high carbon content and high stability of the carbon. This enables the use of biochar as a carbon sink when deposited so that there is no risk of composting. Sampo’s vision has always been to establish a mechanism that will enable the extracting of carbon from the atmosphere into top soils out of the active carbon circulation.     Carbofex operates a commercial proof-of-concept plant in Tampere, Finland. The plant produces EBC-certified biochar and district heat for the city of Tampere’s new “circular economy district” of Hiedanranta.     The concept is to produce biochar to utilise the excess energy for carbon negative heating to replace peat and natural gas. The biochar is also used as a carbon sink, and it is made sure it can not burn during use and that it doesn’t get incinerated after use. The main applications are horticultural growing substrates for plants and water filtration. After the primary use, the biochar is recycled and used as soil amendment for agriculture and landscaping.

For the same reason reversals are not expected in our project, because the verifier checks that the biochar is not shipped to combustive use.   The durable storage of biochar and the carbon dioxide embodied in it can be estimated with the O:C ration received from the laboratory test. In general, a molar ratio of O:C lower than 0.2 appears to provide, at minimum, a 1000-year biochar half-life. There is a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010), which allows to calculate a duration over which 90% of carbon in the biochar remains. The O:C ratio measured in our biochar is 0.021.    Puro methodologies always contain a buffer that covers premature reversals of carbon removal. In the biochar methodology the buffer is currently between 2,5 -5% reflecting the scientifically measured quality of the biochar i.e. the O:C ratio.

Carbon Credits Consulting,Yes,"Reforestation, restoration of degraded lands, biodiversity and native forest protection",Fazenda Nascente do Luar (FNL),Forestry (removal only),,,Afforestation,"Fazenda Nascente Do Luar is a reforestation project, launched in 2015, with the aim of sequestering carbon dioxide by planting 428,375 Eucalyptus trees.
To date, the project has removed more than 138,000 tonnes of CO2.
The project based in Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil) is developed by Carbon Credits Consulting in a private land leased by Agrobusiness Florestas e Pecuaria property of the Vinholy family, who actively participate in the project.

Before FNL project took place, the primary activity for decades in the area was unsustainable cattle ranching (mainly for meat production). Over the years, irrational extensive cattle ranching had caused a serious degradation pastureland with strong signs of land erosion patches and reduction in soil fertility.
For many years, such grasslands have historically been subject to human-induced fires with the objective to reduce tree covers and expand grasslands to develop such extensive cattle ranching activities.
Year after year, a decline in pasture production was recorded, with an inevitable reduction of animal load per hectare resulting in a decreased productivity. All this had led to an alarming decline in the economic return of the farm owners.
Pastures present in the Fazenda were so unproductive that in the dry season, the owner pushed cattle to graze also in Legal  Protected � Reserve areas thus jeopardizing even the few remaining natural areas.

These circumstances did not only lead to a soil impoverishment and a serious decrease in productivity of the Fazenda, but it was also a threat to a dangerous decline in biodiversity of the entire region. 
CDR will be delivered by changing the use of land from extensive cattle ranching to sustainable forest production systems, based on good forestry practices, which will increase the forest cover in the Project region and promote remnant natural forest restoration, generating a landscape of biological and productive corridors that produce financial, social, and environmental services for the region. These impacts include the mitigation of climate change, regulation of water flows, expansion of habitat and conservation of the flora and fauna in the Cerrado Biome zone, where the project is located.","FNL Project governance system is fundamental for its high-quality performance. 
The operational structure and responsibilities for the Project is divided into three basic departments: General management, technical management, and operators. 

a) General Management (Carbon Credits Consulting), project proponent, developer, and owner: supervise and manage the executive management, supported by internal technical management bodies and relevant committees to deliver all project targets guaranteeing the quality of the silvicultural activities performed in the field, and the environmental industrial safety and occupational health standards. Co-founder and Project Manager of Carbon Credits Consulting, Dr. Davide Rossi, has been working since 2005 in Brazilian reforestation projects, with experience ranging from planting, maintenance, and processing of trees according to the use-purpose phases.

b) Technical management, this includes administrative coordination, plantation manager, human resources coordination, and environmental coordination: they mainly manage and control data and parameters locally. The staff is composed of specialized +7year experience in managing forest activities with high experienced backgrounds (engineers, forestry technicians, farm managers) and qualified staff (experience in a specific task). The team includes individuals with significant experience in AFOLU project design and implementation, carbon accounting and
reporting under VCS Program. The Forest Manager, Mr. Ranieri De Souza, graduated from the Faculdad de Ciaªncias Sociais e Agra¡rias de Itapeva, S o Paulo (Brazil) and is a forestry engineer. Also, the Deputy Forest Manager of the Fazenda, Heitor Vincesotto Tomiazzi, graduated from the Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do
Sul- UFMS, Campus Chapad o do Sul-MS, is a forestry engineer.

c) Operators: workers engaged to low-performance activities that do not require special skills or training to perform their duties. However, they received basic training on sustainable forest management and fire prevention. The company prioritizes the inhabitants of the area where the Project is developed.","In 2013, some years after having launched a very similar project in Mato Grosso do Sul, our team in charge in Brazil led by our Project Manager Dr. Davide Rossi, discovered some deforested areas in the Cerrado area, after having identified the threats to the ecosystem and especially for biodiversity, Carbon Credits Consulting conducted a feasibility study with the support of the local company Agrobusiness Floresta e Pecua¡ria Ltda, for the realization of a carbon sequestration project. The idea was that of changing the usual practices of the forest where, at that time, unsustainable cattle ranching was practiced causing soil erosion and degraded lands, also, the spread of human-induced fire was common, causing more and more areas of native forest devastated.  After two years of both analytical and economic studies, at the beginning of 2015 works to level, enrich, and recover 342 ha of heavily degraded soil started.
In April 2015 the Fazenda Nascente do Luar reforestation project started with the first plantings of Eucalyptus, a species identified as the one with the highest carbon sequestration for this area in specific, due to the high rainfall and the long photo-period that characterize the climate of the region. The plantlets were bought by a Brazilian company specialized on produce monoclonal plantlets of Eucalyptus spp. And planted at a density of 1,250 per hectare.
The main objective of the project at first was carbon sequestration, which in turn recovered degraded areas. Over time and as the trees grew, these degraded areas rejoined the native forest of the Cerrado, forming a natural mosaic that today serves as a biological corridor for native animals of the most biodiverse tropical savanna on the planet. As of today 1,150 ha of natural forest are protected with the project.
From April 2017 to April 2019 Field audits and evaluations of the forest with technicians have been conducted.
In 2020 the project was verified under Verra's VCS program. 
The project has a continuous improvement approach that helps not only the environment but also the communities and the biodiversity in the zone.

In the first-place fires, this can be human-induced or natural. Fire
can occur at any point during the development of the project although the event is likely to increase during winter when it is the dry season.  
From the very beginning of the project, the fire risk control was carefully taken into consideration. Indeed all the planted areas have been subdivided into smaller parcels, of various dimensions, with each one separated by anti-fire corridors of
between 10 and 20 meters in width. The risk of fires is practically non-existent during the rainy season because of the high level of humidity present in both the soil and vegetation that prevent it. We also have a specific management plan for fires and the operating staff is trained for prevention and control; every year, all workers attend an anti-fire course.
Additionally, we have identified another important natural risk, which is the growing dry vegetation, especially in the winter months (dry season), which is often coupled with high solar radiation and high potential evapotranspiration. To this matter, our expertise team works together with our operational team to prevent possible degradation of land, and to enrich the soil. Our irrigation system allows the soil moisture, the necessary equipment such as water hydrants is always present on the farm, and there is a cooperation between neighbors which helps our surveillance system to be more alert especially during this time of the year.
A final factor that we take into consideration is extreme weather, which can arise due to global warming. Hurricanes and Floods can occur in the project area. However, as our risk assessment shows, the undulating reliefs that characterize the Project Area do not allow the accumulation of water and subsequent flooding in the planted areas of the Project Area. The entire Fazenda Nascente do Luar is located in an elevated area with undulations and hence presents no real risk of flooding. On the other hand, Eucalyptus, due to its incredible flexibility, is able to withstand such extreme events.",30,30,"Being a Verra VCS certified project, the project has a verified durability of 30 years, however, it is projected to be extended for another 30 years and so on, following the verification statutes, which in the case of Verra the first cycle guarantees that no tree felling will be carried out for the duration of the project, as well as a 10% buffer that covers possible risks related to the project.","We work under a preventive approach, which means that re-emission of carbon into the atmosphere is constantly monitored and highly unlikely. Formally, reversals of sequestered carbon to the atmosphere are calculated in each verification period. In the event carbon being re-emitted to the atmosphere, the Buffer Mechanism, defined by VERRA standard will be used, this approach guarantees the buyer, all carbon credits acquired from the project activities are permanent. 
The number of GHG credits issued to the Project is determined by subtracting out the buffer credits from the net GHG emission reductions or removals (including leakage) associated with the Project. The buffer credits are calculated by multiplying the non-permanence risk rating (as determined by the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool) times the change in carbon stocks.
The non-permanence risk rating of the Project is derived from the risk calculation and corresponds to 10 %. The number of GHG credits issued to the Project, considering the buffer credits, is calculated in the document Ex-ante ERs Estimation Schedule.","The Project will follow the methods from IPCC GPG for LULUCF, GPG 2003, and the modalities and procedures for A/R project activities to estimate baseline net GHG removal by sinks, leakage, actual net GHG removal by sinks, and net anthropogenic removal by sinks. In the context of this methodology, the major sources of uncertainties related to changes in carbon stock in the living biomass pool include: natural factors such as fire and pest outbreaks; stand variables such as variation in the yield tables, allometric equation, biomass expansion factor (BEF), wood density, and carbon fraction. All these activities already follow an internal strategy for mitigation as mentioned in  Project Risk � section. ","Should there be a reversal of sequestered carbon, the Buffer Mechanism, defined by VERRA standard will be used. ","The number of GHG credits issued to the Project is determined by subtracting out the buffer credits from the net GHG emission reductions or removals (including leakage) associated with the Project. The buffer credits are calculated by multiplying the non-permanence risk rating (as determined by the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool) times the change in carbon stocks.The non-permanence risk rating of the Project is derived from the risk calculation and corresponds to 10 %. The number of GHG credits issued to the Project, considering the buffer credits, is calculated in the document Ex-ante ERs Estimation Schedule. ",10%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"For FNL project, Carbon Credits Consulting is giving priority to Microsoft s RFP over the market, we are offering our existing inventory for Microsoft s FY22(100,000) and would like to work on a multi-year contract open to offtakes for our following verifications that are scheduled every 2 years (next verification is programmed for Q4 2022) At the moment of this proposal, we don t have a request on minimum or maximum annual volume.","In the following future periods the offer on tons/price might differ from the actual FY22 proposal, longer offtake deals do not relate to FY22 proposal.

Carbon sequestration was measured according to the A/R Large-scale Consolidated Methodology, Afforestation and Reforestation of lands except for wetlands (Version 02.0), the baseline estimation is given as equation 1 of the AR-ACM0003 methodology)  “ VERRA standard. 
To estimate the carbon stock in tree biomass at a point in time, the following tool was used:  Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities �, AR-TOOL14 (Version 04.1). According to Section 8.2 of this tool, this method is used for ex-ante estimation (projection) of carbon stock in tree biomass. 
Tree biomass estimation An equation for Eucalyptus uro-grandis derived from age has not been found. The equations available for this species depend on allometric parameters and there is not an available database today with allometric parameters that allow us to adjust a time equation to estimate the ex-ante carbon stocks. Considering this, at the project description, the annual increment in volume of wood suitable for industrial processing value (IV) of 36.25 m3ha-1year-1 (trunk biomass volume) was used in combination with other parameters derived from ANNEX 3A.1  Biomass Default Tables for Section 3.2 Forest Land � of IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF, to find the total biomass per hectare.

In particular the project contributes as follow:

SDG 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere: The project has an indirect positive impact on SDG 1 by build the resilience of the local communities when in vulnerable situations to reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters. The project also ensures that all men and women have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, appropriate new technology (a parabolic antenna was installed to provide internet access to local communities), and financial services, including microfinance. 
SDG 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture: The project is promoting sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems (target 2-4) the possibility for workers to cultivate their own sustainable orchards and fruit trees is granted.
SDG 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages: The project promotes the well-being and good health of all community workers through a variety of aspects, among which better conditions of living including proper houses, drinking water, free commuting, orchards to cultivate healthy food, and internet access (a satellite dish was installed during the project).
SDG 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all: The project provides strong empowerment to community workers, through training and knowledge in agroforestry management, contributing to a more stable and technically skilled workforce.
SDG 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls: Project management gives women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control.
SDG 6. Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All: The project is promoting  sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems (target 2-4) the possibility for workers to cultivate their own sustain
SDG 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all: Project activities have stimulated an increase in the local workforce employed in the Project Zone, when the unique activity of the Fazenda was cattle breeding only 5 workers were employed in the Fazenda. Today more than 30 workers are employed and receive a salary 60% higher than the minimum wage.
SDG 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns: The project indirectly contributes to target 12-8 creating awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature. All local employees respect nature landscapes and wildlife in the zone.
SDG 13. Take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impact. NOTE: focus response on the project's ability to enhance resilience in the face of climate change impacts (e.g., disaster reduction).	The project contributes to climate change mitigation through the planting of 428,375 trees that have sequestered more than 150,000 tons of CO2.Thanks to the project, more than 1,150 hectares of native forest (Savannah) are protected and preserved; 342 hectares of degraded and unusable land have been recovered and brought to maximum carbon removal capacity. In addition, the project improves soil productivity, reduces water evaporation, reflectance of the soil, and temperatures.
SDG 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss	The restoration and protection of the native forest has generated multiple benefits for biodiversity particularly for wild animals that now find food and protection. The mosaic landscape created by the project has allowed the reentry of many bird and mammal species that had previously disappeared. Among them are species considered by the IUCN as endangered and vulnerable: the jaguar, the puma, the ocelot, the maned wolf, the tapir, the pampas deer, the giant anteater, and the
If the project will have any contributions to the remaining SDGS (9, 16, and 17), please elaborate here.	
SDG 17. The project thorugh its project developer Carbon Credits Consulting,  has a commitment to strengthening means of implementation and renewing collaborative partnerships to create sustainable development.","Measuring the co-benefits of our project has been one of the biggest challenges, as they are sometimes subjective and involve a non-standardized measurement. 
For Carbon Credits Consulting, transparency is highly important. We value transparency and accountability when it comes to co-benefits, we use all available data and resources, as well as technical know-how and capacity when measuring, monitoring, and evaluating the co-benefits impacts inside our project. We conduct impact assessment tools occasionally to monitor co-benefits and most important we verify all of them periodically. 
","Overall, the project offers better life opportunities through work, training, decent pay, and the creation of new and improved housing. All project activities promote inclusion and make no distinction of gender, race, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, and/or any other diverse background. Specifically, Project management gives women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control.","There are not any negative environmental or social impacts of the project. Each participant has been able to express his point of view on the Project. None of the participants demonstrated negative opinions on the Project, indeed they understood the importance of the Project and expressed their desire for the Project to continue.",,,,,,
Carbon Cycle GmbH,,Production of certified biochar in Germany," Carbon Cycle, 001, Rieden, DE",Other (specify),"PyCCS, Biomass conversion with pyrolysis to stabile storage in biochar",,,"Carbon cycle is an innovative and sustainable agriculture company based in south-eastern Germany. The goal of the company is production of high-quality biochar which offers solutions to the problems of modern agriculture. The product has many benefits; the loss of nutrients and nitrate leaching are reduced, the use of fertilizers is considerably reduced, groundwater is protected, and soil fertility is sustainably improved. The production of one ton of high-quality biochar, results in 2,8 tons of harmful carbon dioxide becoming firmly bound for centuries enabling the responsible farmer to make an important contribution to climate and environmental protection.  The cascade usage of biochar begins with the feeding of ÖKO FEED biochar and the use of ÖKO TERR for the litter. Animal health, animal welfare and the climate are improved, and the biochar is charged with nutrients. The ÖKO TERR biochar can also be loaded with liquid manure and thus becomes a valuable natural fertilizer when it is applied to the soil.    Carbon cycle sells its biochar to the farming industry in several EU countries. The biochar has been approved as a soil additive and as animal feed. Carbon cycle has the European certificate of sustainable produced biochar.    Untreated wood chips from regionally and sustainably managed forests (FSC / PEFC) are used to manufacture the premium biochar.     Each tonne of biochar sequesters 2,8 tonnes of CO2 for over 1000 years. Using the O-molar ratio from the analysis of the product the stability of the carbon content can be accurately measured. Using this methodology, Carbon Cycle biochar has an expected carbon removal duration in excess of 17 000 years.    Carbon cycle started production in 2019 with a highly efficient e-flox design. The plan is to scale up production from 2 to 6 kilns during 2021. The revenue from the sales of CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) is an essential part of the business case for further investment.    Carbon Cycle will be issued with CORCs by the Puro.earth marketplace in accordance with the Puro methodology for biochar production. All lifecycle emissions are considered.

","Likely leakage  emissions estimated based on the application of the Leakage Module (VMD0009 Estimation of emissions from activity shifting for avoiding planned deforestation and planned degradation (LK-ASP))

In the proposed project area, this analysis showed that the weighted average sugarcane production would be between 26.5 and 27.5 tons of sugarcane per hectare. That is compared to an estimated productivity of between 19.4 and 21.3 tons / hectare for the rest of Belize s available forested areas outside of the current protected areas network (which amounts to an estimated 680,229 hectares). 

That would therefore mean that the forested land within the project area is between 22.6% and 26.9% more productive than potential alternative areas (on average).  Applying the methodology of VMD0009 (VCS 2015), the estimated activity shifting leakage factor required would be (LKCP-ME,c,i) would be 0.2.
 
In addition, the total area of land in Belize appropriate for sugar cane production (excluding the project area) was calculated to be 1,178,491 ha, of which 680,229 ha are currently forested.

Thus, the proportion of this available area that is currently forested (PFc)= 57.7%.

Our experienced staff there includes an Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) certified fire instructor could work with the experienced Belizeans on training a Central Belize Fire Working Group, under the National Wildland Fire Working Group.  ","To better understand the likely minimum and maximum emission reduction potential of the proposed Maya Forest Corridor project, an analysis was done using both more and less conservative assumptions. 

To produce a more conservative estimate, it was first assumed that 82.4% of the forest would be converted over a 13 year period (Table 5) and a leakage factor of 0.7 was applied (Table 6 and 7). This results in an emission reduction potential over a thirty-year period to be estimated at between 1.58 million to 2.3 million t CO2e (Table 7).

However, to produce a less conservative estimate, it was also assumed that 95.5% of the forest would be converted over a 10.5 year period and a leakage factor of 0.7 (Table 8) and leakage factor of 0.4 (Table 9) applied. The least conservative estimate then produces the emission reduction estimate to range from 2.25 million to 3.3 million t CO2e (Table 8) over a thirty-year period.

Our experts have determined that the 0.4 leakage rate can be achieved in the PDD and that the estimates with the 0.4 leakage rate are therefore the most likely scenario with a high degree of confidence.

The main components corresponding to this activity included acquisition of high spatial resolution imagery of the project area for two periods (2015 and 2020), deriving training data for a Machine Learning-based classification of land cover types, the classification of the imagery acquired, some post-processing (e.g. spatial filtering and comparison of the two generated datasets), and extraction of land cover statistics and land cover change statistics. For 2015, 5m spatial resolution RapidEye satellite imagery were acquired via the project lead s university access to the PlanetScope and RapidEye archive (via https://www.planet.com/explorer/). The appropriate RapidEye data were acquired by searching through the data archive and finding a date in 2015 with no cloud cover over the project area, corresponding to 11 February 2015, near the beginning of the dry season.","We will support the Coalition s efforts to implement an effective and targeted public and community engagement strategy aimed at: (i) increasing community benefits from and appreciation of the natural attributes of the corridor, (ii) Fostering positive interactions and use of nature, and (iii) Increasing community participation in the protection of their natural resources.

Carbon Removal AS,Yes,500k tons p.a. DAC project in Norway,Norway DAC project,Direct air capture and storage</span,,,,"
Carbon Removal AS was established with the single purpose to develop a large-scale DAC project in Norway for capture and permanent storage of CO2. Subsequent strategy for the company will be to develop further plants.

Engineering firm Multiconsult conducted a site screening at the end of 2020 that focused on the area around Kollsnes and the area around Melkoya, both in Norway. They assessed  infrastructure and geology, power grids, other infrastructure (natural gas, CO2, waste heat), the environment, other (armed forces, minerals, reindeer husbandry) and local stakeholders (land use plans, zoning plan, landowners, buildings in the area). It showed that in the area in and around an industrial area at  Kollsnes are found in several relevant locations for a DAC facility, including an area within the Energipark that is fully regulated,and with no orange or red flag other than the power grid. This industrial area is also where the Northern Lights terminal is located for transporting CO2 by pipeline offshore for permanent storage. Multiconsult also showed that in the immediate vicinity of Melkoya, both costs and  local reindeer herding will be challenging factors to develop a DAC plant.

CCB manages the Energy Park,  which it owns jointly with the municipality. Dialogue with CCB so far indicates that the site is adequate. Dialogue with the mayor of the municipality suggests the same thing.  As  the project owner, the applicant has  registered a need and applied for grid capacity from local utility BKK.

The project will be based on technology from Carbon Engineering (""CE"") of Canada. CE did a preliminary  process modelling before the summer based on long time series of climate data with hourly resolution for Kollsnes and Melkoya. It produced  significantly better results for Kollsnes than Melkoya. The main reason is  lower load factor on Melkoya  due to longer periods of low temperatures.

In the spring and summer of 2021, CE conducted  a  Front-End Planning 1  study (""FEP1"") for Carbon Removal that focuses on the specific possible construction area in the Energy Park  at Kollsnes. It will be relatively easy to apply much of the results to other possible locations. 

An adequate revenue model for the DAC plant is not yet in place, but Microsoft contracting CDR from the project would be a building block for an adequate revenue model.

","Carbon Removal AS is a project developer with two dedicated individuals with long experience from renewables. These two own 95% of the company. Carbon Engineering is a key partner and supplier of technology.

The resulting carbonated residues from this process can be re-used as aggregates, which have desirable performance characteristics for use in cement blocks, fertilizer, and green roof substrates. This creates a circular value chain which carbonates waste, and redeploys these materials as useful materials in the construction industry.

Our technology has been in operation since the start of 2021 at a major global cement producer (Vicat) in France, and has undergone technical trials in additional markets including the Netherlands (AVR) and Canada (CRH). These early anchor customers have provided a basis from which we have built a full pipeline of commercial opportunities across the globe, in industries like Biomass, Steel, Energy from Waste, and Cement. 

As is often the case, and beyond our early adopters, larger companies can often be hesitant to invest in new forms of technology, especially in sustainability. We see the largest potential accelerator of adoption across industries as a reduction in CAPEX required to acquire/deploy our technology. 

We believe that Microsoft s participation in CDR would provide funding to allow customers access to our technology, without the need for an upfront investment. We anticipate this could accelerate our commercial deployment by a rate of 50% p/a over the next 10 years, and reduce our manufacturing cost by 5% p/a. This reduction in manufacturing cost is reflected in our annually decreasing pricing proposal. Cumulatively this implies removing, and permanently sequestering a total of 3 million metric tons  of CO2 over the next 10 years, 1Mln of which would be enabled as a result of Microsoft s support.

CarbonCo Limited,Yes,AI enabled high integrity NZ native forest regeneration and restoration,CarbonCrop-HoromakaRestoration1-AC-CCPMS1,Forestry (removal only),,,Reforestation,"CarbonCrop Horomaka Restoration1 is a reforestation project targeting the regeneration of native forest on marginal farmland historically created by the clearing of native forest, on Banks Peninsula near the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. CarbonCrop are working with the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust, Rod Donald Trust, and local landowners to create commercial models supporting the retirement of such marginal land in accordance with best practices for landscape remediation and biodiversity maximisation. The majority of the land parcels are either held by individuals who live on site and are taking a role of active stewardship, or land which has been moved into trust with entities actively supporting restoration of the areas in question to a natural state to support biodiversity and reverse historical interventions for farming.
The project initially targets 2,000ha of such marginal land, expanding to 3,000ha and 4,000ha over the following years. The delivery commitments in this proposal cover only the first three years of sequestration, however the intention is that the land be returned to permanent forest and that carbon sequestration will be ongoing, recognised by further credit issuances as the project continues.
This project aligns with other conservation initiatives in the region, however will in itself more than double the area under effective protection and restoration on the peninsula. It is the next major step in a joint plan to restore 30,000ha across the area, with positive impacts for landscape resilience, biodiversity of both plant and animal life, suppression of pest species, and improvement of fresh water quality. Currently, the region has less than 5% indigenous forest cover, from a historic state of 95%+.
The current land use is primarily low-yield animal agriculture, with periodic establishment of early stage regenerating scrub followed by cycles of clearing by fire/herbicide. The significant majority of the CDR payments for this project will be directed to landowners to support the establishment of the forest and cover the economic costs of land retirement from current agricultural use. The remainder go to CarbonCrop and project partners to facilitate the establishment and ongoing monitoring/reporting/verification of this and future projects, and the development of the CarbonCrop technology platform to support broader restoration activities. New Zealand has extremely robust land ownership records and has addressed issues of indigenous land ownership and entitlements through settlement processes under the Waitangi Tribunal.","CarbonCrop is the project developer and coordinator, and will take ongoing responsibility for monitoring/reporting/verification and durability assurance. CarbonCrop is supported by NZ government innovation funding and investors including a leading NZ technology incubator, and has an engineering+product+project-support team of 10 persons, including extensive experience in forestry, artificial intelligence, project delivery, software development, and startups. Since founding, CarbonCrop has been engaged in the assessment under the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme for Forestry of more than 200 projects covering upwards of 100,000 hectares of farmland.

For this project, CarbonCrop has engaged closely with local conservation entities and landowners, foremost amongst which are the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust and Rod Donald Trust - the preeminent organisations for land conservation and restoration within the region, with proven experience delivering more than 70 land protection and forest restoration projects across the region, totalling more than 2,000ha.

CarbonCrop is also working closely with the New Zealand Forestry Service and representatives from the Banks Peninsula Native Forest Climate Change Group, in connection with the validation and refinement of the carbon sequestration measurement and monitoring approaches, and the forest establishment methodologies for maximum resulting biodiversity and resilience.","The CarbonCrop Horomaka project commenced in February 2021, with the definition of the focus region and high level objectives, these being aligned with CarbonCrop s strategic objective of native forest restoration on degraded land in New Zealand.
In June 2021 CarbonCrop engaged with the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust and Rod Donald Trust, who have ongoing activities in land restoration in the project area dating from early 2000. Both organisations have strong connections to landowners within the region with a willingness to engage in regeneration and restoration activities, but are critically constrained by funding, meaning the total extent of regeneration over this period remains very limited vs project goals.
Final commitment of landowners to the project is targeted for End-2021, based on confirmation of a buyer for the resulting carbon credits - this guarantee of revenue is what will enable the landowners to commit to the forest restoration and protection.

The activities of individual stakeholders have been and will continue to be self-financed, with the anticipation of a return through the sale of project carbon credits.

CarbonCrop s involvement allows the areas of land registered to the project to be attributed high-integrity carbon credits in recognition of removals achieved by the regenerating forest; this in turn creates a source of funds which will support the acceleration of regeneration activities far beyond what the various parties have been able to achieve to date.

Key partners in the project are:
- Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust: The BPCT brings 20 years of experience in protecting and regenerating land to restore native forest across banks peninsula. The group has strong experience in project delivery and the allocation of funds to support restoration in collaboration with landowners, in addition to excellent connections to landowners across the area.
- Rod Donald Trust: The Rod Donald Trusts primary objective is with preserving and expanding public access to natural landscapes across Banks Peninsula, however in connection with this the Trust is also a strong and visible advocate for native forest regeneration across the region, and has excellent connections to landowners whose land is well suited to the creation of new native forest.
- Banks Peninsula Landowners: CarbonCrop, together with the two environmental trust partners, has strong and continually expanding connections to interested landowners across the region, with land under ownership significantly in excess of the total target area for the project. The project will initially engage those landowners with areas of land which will most benefit from protection and are in the most mature state of progression (while excluding mature forest land already under effective protection as ineligible). Landowners, together with the BPCT and various service contractors, will be primarily responsible for the necessary forest restoration actions.",1/4/2021,Christchurch,Canterbury,New Zealand,10800,10800,Yes,19500,0,30400,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,95,100,"CarbonCrop's methodology attributes credits only for carbon removals corresponding to the increase in carbon stocks imputed from increases in standing forest biomass within the project boundaries.

This project makes no allocation of credits for reductions in emissions or avoidance of emissions.",No,No certification,,N/A,"a) The boundary for the purposes of life cycle analysis are those activities directly associated with establishment and support of the forest, and associated ongoing monitoring, reporting and verification activities associated with the project. These include forest protection activities including the introduction of any net new stock/pest exclusion fencing and pest control activities. Because the forest restoration is through natural regeneration methods, there is no consideration given to the emissions profile of seedling nursery stage care and/or planting, as no such activities are anticipated. With the exception of project specific travel - which is a very small fraction of the project carbon sequestration by design - all project emissions occur within the project boundary or are embodied in physical components installed within the project boundary (such as fencing).

b) This boundary is set to encompass all significant emissions reasonably attributable to the execution of the project. Due to the nature of the project as the retirement of farmland, there are a significantly broader set of avoided/reduced emissions, however these are excluded from the LCA as measurement would be imprecise and the results irrelevant given the project makes no claim to credits for emissions reductions/avoidance.

c) The only emissions directly attributable to the project outside the boundaries of the projects LCA are those associated with CarbonCrop s system operations. CarbonCrop undertakes to offset or eliminate these emissions in accordance with regional best practices for the area of operation. In future CarbonCrop anticipates offsetting these activities using withheld credits directly resulting from such projects.

d) CarbonCrops operational emissions are excluded from the project LCA as they do not scale linearly with project size or volume and direct attributions to projects would have inconsistent results. External offsetting is more precise and remains consistent with the intent of the LCA analysis.

e) CarbonCrops project attributable CDR tonnage for this project is estimated in the region of 40T/yr, based on the project s scale within CarbonCrops forecast overall portfolio.

CarbonCrops methodology is being developed in alignment with best practices from Verra methodologies for Improved Forest Management for forest protection. CarbonCrop anticipates securing Verra approval for the new methodology - with a particular emphasis on new techniques for carbon stock assessment and reversal detection.","Net negative tonnage is based on established removals methodology applied under the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme for Forestry. The science underpinning the methodology has been extensively vetted by the NZ Ministry for Environment, Landcare Research, and NZ Forestry Service, and us publicly available at  https://www.mpi.govt.nz/forestry/forestry-in-the-emissions-trading-scheme/ 
CarbonCrops methodology improves on spatial and forest-type resolution of the standard methodology by drawing on the data compiled within the New Zealand National Vegetation Survey dataset available here: https://nvs.landcareresearch.co.nz/
These 20,000+ sample sites across New Zealand are used to inform New Zealands reporting under the IPCC Paris treaty. CarbonCrops models are being informed by this data and are under review by the New Zealand Forest Service.
As a component of the project, CarbonCrop will secure 3rd party field measurements to validate those undertaken by CarbonCrop in support of the sequestration inference model, and further cross-validate the imputed sequestration rates against equivalent projects within the project region which are using standard forest biomass models.

CarbonCrops methodology is being developed in alignment with best practices from Verra methodologies for Improved Forest Management for forest protection. CarbonCrop anticipates securing Verra approval for the new methodology - with a particular emphasis on new techniques for carbon stock assessment and reversal detection.",Yes,,"The three largest risks for this project are as follows:
1. Landowner engagement and commitment: In order to deliver CDR tonnage under the CarbonCrop model, landowners must commit to the terms and timeframes of the project. CarbonCrop is working directly with the major conservation authorities for the project region and has strong relationships with multiple landowners well in excess of the total required to deliver on the committed CDR for the project. These landowners require a purchase commitment for the tonnage in question to finalize their engagement.

2. Reversal risk: The candidate regenerating forest areas are loosely clustered geographically. The forest type is historically not heavily prone to accidental reversal through flood nor wind, however fire presents some risk - however the nature of the regenerating forest (being highly diverse rather than monoculture) is relatively fire resistant; past fires are rare and have been effectively controlled. In combination with the strong land ownership records in NZ and the restrictions and obligations which will exist on the areas of land for restoration, the risk of deliberate reversal through land conversion are low. CarbonCrop is further exploring the possibility of a midterm shift to Ton-Year accreditation of carbon credits and the bundling of credits to produce CO2Ton@GWP100 equivalent parcels, primarily to further streamline reporting and ensure stronger effective guarantees of durability.

3. Forest sequestration rate assurance: Quoted CDR tonnage is based on modelled carbon sequestration rates for the regions in question, derived from extensive vegetation sample points and adjusted for species mix and environment. Target deliveries have been set conservatively vs anticipated sequestration for the project target areas, however the actual sequestration awarded will be based on the results of site surveys and appropriate further model revisions. There is the possibility (depending on environmental profile and site specific conditions, effectiveness of pest control, and other factors) that the forest areas will not collectively achieve the target sequestration levels despite the conservative targeting. In this event, CarbonCrop will deliver only the quantity of Carbon Removals assessed, and will not expect payment for undelivered tonnage.",100,30,"The durability term of the project is based on the commitment period the landowner is under contract for. The credits being sold are based on CO2-GWP100 equivalent warming potential, hence the obligation period for sequestration is set to 100 years. The landowner is obligated to remediate any reversals within this period sufficient to meet the committed term.

The durability guarantee is the term over which CarbonCrop anticipates credits will continue to be awarded to the project and sold, and the term over which CarbonCrop commits to ongoing measurement/reporting/verification of the project - including monitoring for and investigation of any detected reversals to ensure appropriate landowner response.

As an additional provision to manage temporal mismatches between committed/recognised sequestration and true sequestration following any reversals, CarbonCrop will maintain a limited buffer pool equivalent to 5% of total credits issued, however the overall responsibility for addressing reversals lies with the landowner.

In the event of reversal due to an unexpected event, the landowner will carry an obligation to support the restoration of the forest in question, and credits awarded for sequestration will be paused until the carbon stocks at the time of the event are achieved once more.

In the event of reversal due a deliberate act, the landowner will be liable for securing an equivalent volume of credits to those lost through reversal to substitute.

The landowner obligation extends to 100 years, aligning with the GWP100 assessed term.

The durability guarantee is only given for the 30year reversal monitoring commitment period. Over this period, CarbonCrop provides ongoing monitoring of forest extent, growth rates, species mix and progression, and any clearances as an intrinsic part of the at-least-annual monitoring/measurement activities conducted as part of the sequestration assessment associated with the attribution of credits for sequestration over the year prior.
Commitments to replace any reversals (with the buffer pool as a temporal buffer only) will survive the expiration of the monitoring period, through to the 100 year durability term.

It is material to the guarantee regarding prevention and remediation of reversals to note that the forest created in connection with this project is a permanent, indigenous forest, not intended for logging. Once forest state is achieved, the forest will be protected under New Zealand law through the forests act, in addition to protection through the contractual commitments to the project. This state will be achieved by the 30y durability guarantee term expiry.","CarbonCrop provides ongoing monitoring of forest extent, growth rates, species mix and progression, and any intentional or unavoidable losses of biomass as a core part of CarbonCrops responsibilities within the scope of the project. This is achieved by:
- The application of trained forest attribute assessment models operating on remote sensing data from satellite imagery and periodic public aerial imagery, specifically targeting detection of canopy loss, and;
- As an intrinsic part of the at-least-annual monitoring/measurement activities conducted as part of the sequestration assessment associated with the attribution of credits for sequestration over the year prior.

These monitoring activities will continue beyond the indicated delivery and periods under this RFP, in connection with continued assessment of future forest carbon sequestration and issuance of credits for same.","The primary reversal risks for the project are:
Accidental reversal through fire
Accidental reversal through storm damage
Accidental reversal through landslide
Deliberate reversal through clearing of land
Reversal risk for this project through fire/storm/landslide is lower than for similar forests in the region due to the emphasis on diverse, locally sourced, climate appropriate regenerating forest. These forests have been empirically demonstrated to be less susceptible to fire, high winds, and erosion - in fact in many cases forests of this type reduce erosion as compared to the status quo.

The risk of deliberate reversal through clearing of land is dramatically lower for this class of project and forest due to both the protections which will be in place in connection with the project directly, and the protections which will exist for the forest state under New Zealand law once the forest is established.","In the event of reversal due to an unexpected event, the landowner will carry an obligation to support the restoration of the forest in question, and credits awarded for sequestration will be paused until the carbon stocks at the time of the event are achieved once more. Any temporal shortfall in credits issued vs current sequestration will be met through the allocation of a fraction of the buffer pool; this buffer pool will be replenished as the forest is restored and re-attains the original carbon stock.

In the event of reversal due a deliberate act, the landowner will be liable for securing and surrendering an equivalent volume of credits to those lost through reversal by way of substitute. Any temporal shortfall during the acquisition of these equivalent credits will be met through allocation of a fraction of the buffer pool.","The buffer pool comprises 5% of the total sequestration attributed to THIS project. Credits are issued for this sequestration, but held in reserve by CarbonCrop for the project. The buffer pool contains only credits for removals. In the event that a landowner must secure external credits to meet obligations for a deliberate reversal, the replacement credits secured must also be native forest removal credits.",5 percent of credits generated by the project are committed to the buffer pool.,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"The desired initial multiyear offtake term is as outlined in Volume By Period and Price By Period.
For years after 2024 we anticipate 30,000T/annum being available through this project, and would be open to delivery of any quantity in excess of 10,000T at the prices indicated.
Based on the forest type and environment we anticipate this sequestration rate to continue through at least 2070. We are open to a longterm offtake agreement based on an agreed discount to a mutually established market price indicator.","The terms of delivery for future carbon will remain as for the CDR's offered under this contract, with pricing for FY23 and FY24 as indicated in Price By Period, and pricing for future years based on a to-be-agreed discount vs a market price discovery mechanism.","Removals are attributed based on the incremental annual increase in forest biomass, converted to TonsCO2 equivalent using species-mix appropriate equations developed by New Zealand Landcare Research, the New Zealand Forest Service/Scion, NZ Ministry for the Environment, and NZ Ministry for Primary Industries - all for the purposes of sequestration estimation under New Zealands Emissions Trading Scheme for Forestry.

These forest-type specific sequestration rates are the basis of CarbonCrop s sequestration rate modelling, and are parameterised by forest age and forest species mix. CarbonCrop then uses periodic field measurements across a representative mix of species and environments within the specific project boundaries to calibrate the models to local growth and vegetation conditions.

Three key innovations of the CarbonCrop approach aid the removal/sequestration measurements, these are outlined in the following confidential category ""Technology Innovations"".

The following specific measures are applied in support of sequestration measurement.

In-situ Sampling: CarbonCrop's sequestration attribution involves the use of in-situ non-destructive sampling based on best practice under the NZ ETS Field Management Approach, involving 20m permanent sample plots and the measurement of all significant tree species within those areas using standard allometry techniques. Where available, CarbonCrop uses existing sample data from publicly available datasets to reduce the density of sample points required and increase overall accuracy of sequestration attribution. The density of in-situ sample points and sampling intervals is informed by the standard Field Measurement Approach advocated under the NZ ETS - however the ability to apply out-of-sample data in a reliable manner through the techniques described under 'Innovations' and attribute inference allows an increased overall accuracy across multiple projects while reducing the sample density required within any given project.

Modelling: Base sequestration models are based on the established lookup tables developed for indigenous species in connection with New Zealand s emissions trading scheme for forestry. These have in turn been informed by a network of 20,000 long term vegetation sampling point across a mix of ecosystems across the country, with the carbon sequestration per unit of biomass for various classes of forest having being developed using various standardised allometric equations and field studies to verify the dry biomass and carbon content for a given unit of standard biomass.
CarbonCrop's methodology applies these standard sequestration rates and calibrates them to local conditions using the results of both in-situ sampling conducted (or available) within the project boundary, and also in-situ sampling available from outside the project boundary matched to the relevant vegetation through the use of CarbonCrops innovations.
CarbonCrop core technologies were originally developed in the Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute - we are rigorous in the application of Machine Learning techniques to our problem space where applicable, and equally aware of those situations better suited to classical data science and statistical techniques. We collaborate with specialists in forest ecology to incorporate proven forestry science models into our systems.

Remote sensing: CarbonCrop s model relies extensively on remote sensing data for initial opportunity assessment, establishment of baselines, measurement of ongoing sequestration across distinct properties within the project, and monitoring and measurement of reversals occurring in relation to the project. The following remote sensing types are used: Low resolution multispectral satellite data; High resolution visible spectrum aerial imagery; High resolution aerial LIDAR, Historical aerial imagery, Low and Medium resolution Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar. We also use publicly available terrain models and climate/rainfall/temperature/soil data to help inform forest progression models.",4000,Approx 5T/ha/yr at current growth stage,"Various, peaking at approximately 12T/ha/yr with project species mix and environment","Water Stewardship: Improved water quality within catchment areas; reduced surface runoff; reduced erosion; reduced turbidity; reduced pollutants in water; increased soil water retention; reduced flood susceptibility; improved drought resilience.
Waste Reduction: None anticipated.
Ecosystem protection: Increased biodiversity through natural regeneration; Habitat restoration for native species; Pest species control.
Social equity and justice: Natural landscape remediation and restoration of historic ecosystem services for all stakeholders; Climate change response participation for small/diverse landowners.
Climate Resilience: Improved drought resilience; Improved wildfire resilience; Improved water catchment reliability; Reduced flood susceptibility.

The project supports the following UN SDG s:
3: Good health and wellbeing
6: Clean water and sanitation
11: Sustainable communities
13 Climate action
14: Life below water
15: Life on land
17: Partnerships for the goals 
","The above co-benefits are all known benefits of the restoration of indigenous forest through natural regeneration, and have been verified to be directly correlated with existing forest regeneration activities in the target region.
Direct measurements for the project are primarily the monitoring of the extent and progression of the native forest, especially considering species diversity and maturity, in connection with ongoing sequestration monitoring activities.
The pest control programs planning and effectiveness monitoring also allow verification of pest species status and the level of threat to native wildlife.","An explicit goal of the project is to provide access to carbon credits as a funding source for reforestation and regeneration to a diverse range of property sizes and current land use categories that are unable to access funding through conventional carbon markets due to their small scale or high project complexity/vegetation diversity.
CarbonCrop is dedicated to providing access to all parties, and is proud to work with both the Banks Peninsula Trust and Rod Donald Trust, being agencies dedicated to the restoration of native forest across the region for the public good, and the establishment of public access to the restored natural landscapes wherever possible.
The increased biodiversity and natural ecosystem services + climate resilience will benefit all populations around the project area.
","The project is subject to the following environmental and social risks, and addresses them with mitigations as described below.

Displacement of food production: The conversion of agricultural land to forest is a possible threat to food security. CarbonCrop supports the restoration of forest to only historically forested landscapes, with only indigenous forest, and only where the existing use is of marginal agricultural productivity and has been allowed to degrade past the point of usefulness as farmland. This prevents any impact on food security, through leakage or otherwise.

Introduction and proliferation of non-native and environmentally ill-suited species: The rapid growth possible with exotic tree species makes them highly attractive as a carbon sequestration crop, however the resulting low biodiversity monocultures of environmentally unsuited trees are extremely harmful to wildlife, other indigenous vegetation, water quality, and carry high risk of reversal through accidental events. CarbonCrop does not attribute any carbon sequestration to exotic forest species within the project scope, to avoid the creation of a perverse incentive for the establishment of such species.",,,,,,
CarbonCure Technologies Inc.,Yes,Permanent and verifiable storage of atmospheric CO2 in concrete,CarbonCure's CDR & Circular Manufacturing Solution,CO2 utilization (specify the source of the CO2),Atmospheric CO2 using biogenic waste pathways in renewable natural gas (RNG) processing,,,"This year s submission reflects the two areas of feedback received from last year s RFP. Specifically, CarbonCure has increased the ratio of permanent CO2 mineralization associated with the commercialization and deployment of two new technologies. Secondly, a new source of atmospheric CO2 will be used with enhanced life cycle impacts. 

For this year s RFP, CarbonCure is submitting a project whereby Microsoft would enable the combination of two new innovations that would accelerate and scale the carbon removal market: 1) the commercialization of CarbonCure's two newest technologies which together could reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by ~375 million tonnes annually by 2030 and 2) long-term storage of atmospheric CO2 within carbontech products.  Additionally, this project would create a scalable model to combine Carbon Removal and Circular Manufacturing attributes. The atmospheric CO2 source and concrete product feedstocks are industrial wastes which provide long-term CO2 storage and other water and solid waste co-benefits.

This project will provide CDR by capturing atmospheric CO2 using biogenic waste pathways in renewable natural gas (RNG) processing and mineralizing it in concrete waste products. RNG is produced from biogas, which typically consists of methane and carbon dioxide. We intend to offtake atmospheric CO2 from existing biogas operations at municipal landfill and wastewater treatment facilities. Today, the methane from biogas is being utilized for RNG, however, the biogenic waste CO2 is being released into the atmosphere. CarbonCure will provide the multi-million $ capex investment for the equipment required to capture, liquify, and transport the CO2 - from RNG plant to a network of concrete producers - and then permanently mineralize the CO2 in concrete utilizing CarbonCure's carbon removal technologies for Reclaimed Water (RW) and Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) feedstocks.

This atmospheric CO2 will be mineralized through the use of CarbonCure's two latest technologies which feature Carbon Removal and Circular Manufacturing attributes, namely the carbonation of Reclaimed Water and Recycled Concrete Aggregate. CarbonCure's Reclaimed Water technology recently won the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE where it was selected as the world s most scalable breakthrough technology to convert CO2 emissions into usable products.

If Microsoft were to purchase CDR credits from this project, they would be the first entity to do so.  The proceeds received from Microsoft's purchase of CDR credits would enable CarbonCure to implement this first-of-its-kind turn-key CDR solution by providing: 1) the incentive that gets concrete producers to adopt CarbonCure's newest technologies and maximize the % of their production utilizing them and 2) the necessary demand that then enables CarbonCure to make the required multi-million $ upfront capex investment for all atmospheric CO2 capture, transportation and mineralization equipment components.","There are three key parties in this project - 1) CarbonCure 2) concrete producers and 3) the RNG plant for the atmospheric CO2 offtake.

CarbonCure will operate as the project developer responsible for the execution of this project. It will provide each of the following:

- The execution of the agreement with the RNG plant for atmospheric CO2 offtake.
- The capital for the capex purchase of the equipment to capture, liquify and transport the CO2. It will also own and operate this equipment.
- The enrollment of concrete producers to utilize CarbonCure's technologies, as well as the ongoing support thereafter.
- The technology and capital for the capex purchase of the equipment required to mineralize the CO2, including CarbonCure for Reclaimed Water and Recycled Concrete Aggregate.
- The creation of the digital network to directly generate the credits according to the VERRA protocol and subsequently measure, monitor, verify and audit the carbon credits in real-time at each concrete facility worldwide.

Concrete producers will utilize CarbonCure's technologies in their normal, ongoing concrete production.

The RNG plant will also operate their plants as they do today, however, their atmospheric waste CO2 will be getting captured rather than emitted.

Other additional partners will include a third party engineering firm who will install the required CO2 equipment and a third-party verifier (should Microsoft require external verification). In each case, CarbonCure has identified the parties they would work with.

CarbonCure is confident in its ability to successfully execute this project as it has:

- Already installed it s Concrete Mixer technology in over 400 concrete plants over 4 continents in a variety of concrete verticals, namely ready mix, precast and masonry products.
- Successfully developed and proved each of its two newest technologies as demonstrated by the Carbon XPRIZE win.
- Successfully licensed the first commercial Reclaimed Water technology and began supplying low-carbon concrete to hundreds of construction projects. Engaged in advanced sales discussions with other concrete producers to adopt the technology.
- Completed 3 years of laboratory R&D and industrial scale pilot of the Recycled Concrete Aggregate carbonation technology. Secured industrial supply chain partners to deploy the technology. 
- Completed the engineering, regulatory and permitting review of CO2 capture from RNG projects. Identified and began conversations with RNG plants for the atmospheric CO2 offtake agreements. 
- Identified and received quotes for the required equipment, and for the other key third party partners mentioned above.","Since CarbonCure s inception in 2012, it s technology roadmap included the commercialization of a Reclaimed Water and Recycled Concrete Aggregate mineralization technology after the Concrete Mixer technology was commercialized in the ready mix, masonry and precast concrete verticals. 

CarbonCure has been involved in alternative CO2 capture projects since 2017 and 2018 with the completion of the world s first (and yet to be repeated) fully integrated point source CO2 capture from a cement kiln (in Calera, Alabama) and utilization in concrete production. 

For the full end-to-end solution, this is a project that would be implemented and operationalized following Microsoft's decision to move forward with CarbonCure.

CarbonCure has strategized and engaged in conversations to access atmospheric CO2 for multiple years. Based on this multi-year effort, it has identified the sourcing of atmospheric CO2 using biogenic waste pathways in RNG processing as the most readily available, proximate, scalable solution to accelerate carbon removal.

CarbonCure has dedicated its senior management to this effort, and over the course of 2021, invested heavily in it including hiring dedicated resources and working with third party experts in order to enable it to fully scope out the end-to-end solution.

CarbonCure would provide the required financing for the capex necessary to implement the project.

As CarbonCure has already fully scoped out this project, it would be ready to begin implementation immediately following Microsoft's agreement to pre-purchase CDR credits generated from it. Specifically, it could do so by the fall of 2021.",6/1/2022,San Francisco,CA,United States,500,500,Yes,12000,12000,25000,25000,53000,53000,87000,108000,93000,234000,95000,365000,98000,505000,100000,654000,103000,813000,105000,980000,,,,,,,100,20,"These removal figures are based on actual calculations that CarbonCure has generated from its rigorous technology development and empirical field testing of industrial operations.

CarbonCure s technology provides GHG benefits in two ways: 1) by mineralizing captured CO2 in concrete products, and 2) by reducing carbon emissions through the reduction of cementitious materials made possible by the strength benefit imparted by the mineralized CO2.  The total GHG benefits are net of any process emissions that occur through the use of our technology to create these GHG benefits.

Removed emissions are calculated as a ratio of CO2 mineralized per unit of CO2 utilized. For example, one tonne (1000 kg) of CO2 utilized in a process that achieves mineralization at 93% efficiency would see 930 kg of CO2 converted and 70 kg of CO2 considered as leakage within the LCA boundary.

Reduced emissions are calculated as the difference in GHG impacts of concrete produced using the technologies as compared to an equivalent concrete mix that does not use the technologies. The reduced emissions do not include the mineralized CO2 (captured within the scope of removed emissions) but largely revolve around the more efficient use of cement. A net reduction in cement consumption can be calculated on a batch or project basis.

Process emissions are calculated on the basis of a tonne of CO2 processed and include aspects such as electrical consumption of the required equipment and transport distances of the processed CO2.

For the volume of carbon credits provided in the earlier calculations, please note that these were on an LCA basis (i.e., net of the emissions that occur to mineralize the CO2).  CarbonCure projects the effective efficiency rate to conservatively be ~80% at the start of the project. ",Yes,Verra (VCS),,N/A,,,Yes,,"The three most important risks are all related to timing.  It's not a matter of if or how this project will occur, just a matter of when CarbonCure will achieve the volumes shown.  This is due to the fact that all the required prerequisites already exist and are ready for implementation - CarbonCure's technologies are developed and ready for commercialization, the atmospheric CO2 source is available in excess of the required volumes, and CarbonCure has fully scoped out the project and identified its key partners.

As it relates to the key timing risks, the three largest are:

1) Initial start to the CDR credit generation - the project could begin to generate carbon credits in Microsoft s FY 2023 vs FY 2022 if delays were to occur to items such as the required permitting and date of receiving the capture and liquefaction equipment. In this case, CarbonCure would still project to fulfill the total contracted volume with Microsoft.

2) Year the CDR credits are certified - the initial certification of carbon credits could occur in Microsoft s FY 2023 vs FY 2022 if delays occur to items such as methodology amendments (amendments underway with Verra to add Reclaimed Water and Recycled Concrete Aggregate technologies to VM0043) or to the date Verra provides the certified VCUs to CarbonCure.  This risk assumes that Microsoft requires Verra certified credits, otherwise, Carboncure could provide self-certified credits that alleviates this risk.

3) Delay to contracting with Microsoft for this project - CarbonCure plans to move forward upon the execution of a contract with Microsoft.  If the timing of this were to be delayed, this could set back the timing of the project launch, and thus the fiscal year that Microsoft receives its CDR credits.  Similar to risk #1, CarbonCure would still project to fulfill the total contracted volume with Microsoft.",10000,10000,"CarbonCure determined the expected durability term of the project based on commonly accepted scientific research.  (Source: Al-Mamoori, et al, Energy Technol. 2017).   This research shows that CO2 mineralization can store CO2 in a more stable form for thousands of years via reaction with alkaline earth oxides to form carbonates, offering little risks to permanence.  Carbon mineralization involves reacting carbon dioxide with an alkali-rich feedstock to form solid calcium carbonate (CaCO3).  Not only is this a permanent conversion (lowest energy state for carbon), but the reaction is exothermic, which means the process does not require any energy.

The directly mineralized CO2 will remain as a carbonate mineral even after the concrete reaches the end of its service life when the structure is eventually demolished and returned to the geosphere. To release the CO2 back into the atmosphere from a carbon mineral, one would require the use of a strong acid or very high heat (>700 Â°C) which are two influences that are never accidentally applied to concrete nor part of any processing at the end of service life. The second aspect of the carbon benefit, the reduced CO2 associated with the reduced cement usage, is inherently permanent since the composition of a concrete mix is determined at its time of manufacture.","As described above, the form of storage (mineralization) and the associated timelines for sequestration (permanent, 10,000+ years) are not significant risks for this project. Additionally, no other risks are expected to impact the project due to the mineralization such as climate variability, monitoring difficulty, etc.

It would not be realistic - nor does CarbonCure believe necessary - to monitor for reversals in every unit of concrete that is produced with the technology (there have been more than 13 million cubic yards produced to date) across thousands of projects.","As noted in the Durability and Risk of Physical Reversal response, the directly mineralized CO2 will remain as a carbonate mineral even after the concrete reaches the end of its service life when the structure is eventually demolished and returned to the geosphere. To release the CO2 back into the atmosphere from a carbon mineral, one would require the use of a strong acid or very high heat (>700 Â°C) which are two influences that are never accidentally applied to concrete nor part of any processing at the end of service life. The second aspect of the carbon benefit, the reduced CO2 associated with the reduced cement usage, is inherently permanent since the composition of a concrete mix is determined at its time of manufacture.

As it relates to the accuracy in calculating the # of carbon credits that were initially generated, CarbonCure s proprietary real-time digital traceability application provides a high degree of measurability and verifiability.  CarbonCure s traceability application measures the resulting CO2 reductions through its remote telemetry equipment, and the CO2 reduction information is available on a remotely accessible internal database in real-time.  This allows CarbonCure to account for CO2 utilization process emissions throughout the entire carbon lifecycle (e.g. energy consumption and emissions associated with CO2 capture, CO2 liquefaction, CO2 transportation, and operation of the utilization hardware). These records may be audited at any time to ensure compliance.

The Verra approved methodology provides additional risk mitigation.  This methodology will be constantly evaluated by third-parties and amended to reflect the latest rigorous science to ensure high-integrity carbon credits.  Thus, this methodology will continue to account for any buffer pools or discounts to original crediting that they believe should occur.","For reversal compensation in the case of certified CDR credits that have been delivered to Microsoft, CarbonCure would plan to follow the process outlined in its Verra approved methodology.","Per its Verra approved methodology, a buffer pools is not applied due to the lack of risk of reversals.","Per its Verra approved methodology, a buffer pools is not applied due to the lack of risk of reversals.",Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"The ideal outcome of this proposal is that it enables CarbonCure to launch its latest technologies and to integrate upstream to begin utilizing atmospheric CO2 using biogenic waste pathways in RNG processing.

At the minimum, Microsoft could enable CarbonCure to launch this end-to-end solution by purchasing a minimum of 4,000 carbon credits (the minimum volume to enable CarbonCure to launch its first full end-to-end solution) over a three to five year period.  An outcome that would have a larger impact on scaling the CDR sector would be for Microsoft to purchase a volume of 50,000 credits (the volume for CarbonCure to launch multiple end-to-end solutions in multiple geographies) over a five to ten year period.  

The larger the volume and the longer the offtake agreement, the more it enables CarbonCure to accelerate its CDR solutions and accelerate the broader CDR market.  CarbonCure could accept volumes beyond those offered to Microsoft, including the volumes listed as those offered to the market.  As noted above, CarbonCure would accept offtakes over a five to ten year period.

Ideally, CarbonCure would have agreed to terms with Microsoft for an offtake agreement in the next 60 days, and no later than calendar year end.","The prices offered to Microsoft in this submission assume Microsoft purchases at the volumes shown.  If Microsoft were to purchase volumes that are significantly lower or higher than those offered to it, this would have an inverse impact on the pricing.",,,,,"In addition to the climate benefits, this project provides the following co-benefits from the list above: water stewardship, waste reduction, and social equity and justice.  These are achieved by the following:

- Water stewardship: achieved with CarbonCure s Reclaimed Water technology
- Waste reduction: achieved with CarbonCure s Reclaimed Water and Recycled Concrete Aggregate technologies which divert material normally sent to landfill back into production as value-added material inputs.
- Social equity and justice: achieved with CarbonCure s contribution to local community climate equity projects selected in collaboration with concrete producers and local stakeholders (eg. low carbon affordable housing).

As part of the certification process with Verra, CarbonCure is currently exploring the SDVista certification as well.  CarbonCure would expect the below UN Sustainable Development Goal alignment as part of this process:

- Goal #6: Clean Water and Sanitation
- Goal #9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
- Goal #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- Goal #13: Climate Action","Water stewardship: CarbonCure s Reclaimed Water replaces the amount of required freshwater in addition to reducing the carbon footprint of concrete.

Waste reduction: This project is combining solutions that are all industrial waste products, including the atmospheric CO2 source and the concrete products that provide the long-term CO2 storage.  CarbonCure is enabling the recycling of previous waste.

Social equity and justice: Carboncure contributes 4% of gross proceeds from CDR credit sales to local communities in which our concrete producers operate. These tend to be marginalized fenceline communities. Local concrete suppliers and community stakeholders will be engaged to direct the community investment (eg. affordable, resilient and low carbon housing).

Measurement: CarbonCure collects its impact real time via its traceability application.  The SDVista process may include these specific measurements as well.","This project advances these causes through three key mechanisms:

1) The specific $ contribution to these causes noted above.  CarbonCure is working with its concrete producers in these communities and engaging with leading organizations such as Carbon180 and local community stakeholders on how to maximize its impact with these contributions.

2) Much of concrete production occurs within densely populated fenceline communities.  The technologies utilized are directly reducing the waste products that would otherwise occur and be disposed of within these communities.

3) Improved financial security of those living within these communities.  Many of the employees at the concrete producers live in these communities.  The increased profitability that the concrete producers receive from receiving 50% of the net proceeds from CDR credit sales and through the use of CarbonCure s technologies can increase the profitability of the concrete plants, thereby increasing job security. ","This project does foresee any negative environmental or social impacts.

- All of the equipment, from the CO2 capture equipment to CarbonCure s equipment at the concrete producers, is retrofitted into existing plants, thus it requires no additional land use.
- By virtue of circular manufacturing technologies, these projects exceed expectations of emitting less waste and actually consuming industrial wastes (land, water or air).
- Each of the solutions are removing emissions, not creating new sources.",,,,,,
carbonfuture GmbH,Yes,Drought mitigating biochar applications from California wildfire prevention forest residue,Carbon Future Pacific Biochar 2021,Biochar,,,,"Carbonfuture with it s long-term partner Pacific Biochar are thriving to provide high quality carbon removal credits based on biochar applications in California.
Biochar as a material offers unique properties to sequester and store atmospheric CO2 long-term. Biochar based carbon sinks can be quantified and managed well. Furthermore they offer significant side benefits in their application in agriculture, such as water and nutrient retention and increase crop yield.
Carbonfuture is the leading platform in verifiably documenting and issuing high quality credits.
Every carbon sink is independently certified and audited by the European Biochar Certificate and the carbon-preserving biochar application is documented on the platform.
California offers vast biomass feedstock sources from forestry and agriculture.
Especially sustainably managed forests (FSC certified) and forest thinning to prevent wildfires provide valuable feedstocks for biochar generation. With it s feedstock sources and extensive agriculture, California is predestined for a state-local cyclic biochar economy. Locally produced biochar can be applied in agriculture e.g. to lower water consumption and to increase soil fertilization. Pacific Biochar has access to a broad partner and client network in this area.

Pacific Biochar is following a unique approach to harvest biochar from existing biomass power plants. With several technical modification options, high quality biochar can be produced in these facilities, preventing biomass feedstock from being burnt and CO2 reentering the atmosphere. The production of biochar also provides additional revenue for local plant operators who are looking to diversify their operations away from energy generation.

The sink portfolio offered in this RFP is mainly based on feedstock from high risk wildfire areas. The produced biochar will then be used in soil applications in California to mainly lower water consumption of drought stricken agricultural areas or as soil enrichment with compost additives.
For each of these forms of application, it is ensured according to the EBC Sink guidelines that the biochar ultimately reaches the soil, so the carbon remains permanently sequestered.
The financing through the RFP will allow to expand Pacific Biochars operations in California and to convert 2 existing biomass energy plants going forward.
","Carbonfuture and Pacific Biochar already maintain a successful business relationship, other purchase agreements besides this RFP are the works.
For this project Carbonfuture will be responsible for credit documentation, issuing and sales.
Pacific Biochar will be responsible for biochar production with a 3rd party. For that Pacific Biochar will provide the plant modification and organize the biochar offtake and provide biochar tracking.
The carbon removal credits will be certified and audited by the European Biochar Certificate with their auditor bio.inspecta.
","The partnership between Carbonfuture and Pacific Biochar goes back to early 2020. Together we established the very first biochar based carbon removal credits for the US in November 2020.
Pacific Biochar has been in the business of producing and selling biochar for agricultural applications for over 10+ years.
The very first US credits have been established in collaboration with Humboldt Sawmill and are based on sawmill residue from sustainably managed forests, certified according to FSC.
The current collaboration has already been reliably producing carbon removal credits, which have been documented and traded on the Carbonfuture platform:
https://platform.carbonfuture.earth/balancer/portfolios/view/614e142b-098e-4fe7-8f20-eb65ad1a7015

To expand the current partnership two projects are planned.
The first project is a conversion of a new biomass energy plant to produce 3,000t biochar annually starting 2022.
The second project is a modification of the Humboldt Sawmill biochar production site, target date 2023.
With the modification the current production capacity of 3,000t biochar (7,500t CO2e) would increase to 10,000t biochar (25,000t CO2e), which would be a substantial increase in sequestered CO2.
Pacific Biochar has designed various biomass energy plant conversion models, ranging from light to medium and heavy modifications, yielding a range of biochar production capacities at various investment levels.
The carbon removal credits will allow Pacific Biochar to sell the biochar for carbon preserving applications to off-takers in agriculture at a viable economic level (both for the off-taker and Pacific Biochar).

Cbiochar Inc.,Yes,Sustainable biochar mass-production in Quebec and Canadian maritime provinces.,Cbiochar QcM,Biochar,,,,"This project aims at sustainable mass-production of biochar from forestry refuse by using large versions of the innovative patented RoCC kilns. 

Three sources of wood residues that would eventually decay back to carbon dioxide will be transformed into recalcitrant, stable carbon by thermal pyrolysis: 1) wood left after forest fires (currently standing logs after forest fires are often piled-up for reforestation purposes); 2) wood left by the forestry activities (called slash); 3) wood currently buried or burned by municipalities, golf courses, cabinet makers, private owners, etc. Please note: wood processed in forest fire zones currently obstructs reforestation efforts. Reforested areas can be expanded with biochar production that free wood pilings. 

Cbiochar wants to provide the best carbon removal certificates possible. To reach that goal we will produce biochar on-site using the mobile Rotatable Covered Cavity (RoCC) Kiln technology of Dr. Paul Anderson that we will build and improved as our project progresses. 

When available the project will use electric vehicles such as the Tesla Semis, the Cybertruck, the Ford E-150, the Rivian pick-ups. We will charge with Hydro Quebec's hydro-electricity. We will eventually produce our own on-site wind and solar electricity when the grid is not available (using MASWES 30 kw, or other mobile systems.) ","The governance is in the developing partnership of Drs. Lambert and Anderson who each have specific and complementary skill sets for accomplishing the proposed project and its expansion.   

Dr Benoit Lambert: Founder and President. Was born in Qu bec; lived 18 years in Geneva where he taught sustainable development and international conventions on the environment at two institutions, Geneva University and a business school. He subsequently taught carbon-credits in the world of finance. From 2000 to 2009, Benoit lead the French branch of the DC based Worldwatch Institute as the editor of the annual report State of the World and World Watch magazine (L a‰tat de la plana¨te en frana§ais). Benoit has 17 seasons of hands-on practical experience working with Canadian reforestation. Benoit has done various local and international presentations on biochar. He is a member of the United Nations  soil organic carbon monitoring working group  and a reviewer for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on nature-based climate solutions and negative emissions technologies ”carbon sinks (drawdown), including biochar. He has recently written Biogeotherapy ”life as a geological healing force, currently being reviewed by Discover Sustainability (Springer). 

Paul Anderson is internationally known as Dr TLUD, one of the  pyroneers � of micro-gasification. Since his 2003 retirement (after 30 years of university teaching of geography and mapping science), he is full-time on micro-gasification issues, including fuels, pyrolysis, char production, uses of heat (especially for cooking), and uses of char (especially for biochar). He has attended or conducted twenty week-long stove camps, biochar camps, and hands-on workshops on six continents. Based on efforts since 2014, he developed in 2019-2020 the RoCC kilns that accomplishes biochar production in mid-scale quantities, for which he has a patent (pending). From his base in Illinois (USA), he assists people and projects around the world. His biosketch is on page 50 of his white paper  Climate Intervention with Biochar � that is available at www.woodgas.energy/resources 

The company will have two branches: 1) the service branch for urban/community/industry biomass streams; 2) the mass-production of biochar branch in the northern forests. All projects will have on-site lead supervisors, financial and commercial VPs, etc. The essential pilot work (in the service branch) will start near Sutton, Quebec, a small town 15 miles north of Vermont where we have an agreement with the l'Union des Municipalit  du Qu bec and local mechanics we have identified and already know. For the northern forests initiatives we have contacts with Coop Forestia¨re la Nord-Ca´tia¨re (50 years of experience in forestry with their own multi million dollars worth of machinery, garages, Motel a‰nergie, and hundreds of workers). We might also work with the First Nations engineering firm Ashini (Ilnu nation from Passamit). Verification: currently in contact with Forliance in charge of developing a biochar methodology for Verra. As a test we have filled Forliance preliminary template (not public yet). We could also work with other measurement and verification providers such as the European Biochar Industry Consortium (bio.inspecta.ch), Gold Standard or others that might develop biochar methodologies.

The current proposition is mainly in relation with our northern branch. The RoCC kiln might be used in urban circonstances when fully developed. For now the RoCC will be upgraded for forestry conditions. 
","The history of Cbiochar Inc goes back to Benoit's observations as a planter of 3 million trees during 17 tree planting seasons in 5 Canadian provinces. From Vancouver Island to Quebec, he saw biomass being left behind from forestry or forest fires. It is not being used except for a few small energy projects. Most of it is currently rotting, or worse, being openly burned to make space for reforestation ”so called 'burning contracts', an outrageous practice considering how valuable biochar can be. 

Benoit's experience teaching carbon credits for Abengoa in Seville gave him the idea to come back to Canada and start a biochar industry. We recognize biochar is very stable and well adapted to boreal forests and Canada's urban areas that generate lots of wood wastes. Considering Canada s isolated regions, forestry expertise, and First Nations unemployment, biochar can become as important an industry as are the current logging and the pulp and paper industries. The challenge has been the lack of appropriate, financially viable pyrolysis technology. With this vision in mind, Benoit immediately recognized the potential for the Rotatable Covered Cavity (RoCC) kiln technology developed by Dr. Paul  Anderson in 2020.

While he worked from 2001 to 2015 to develop and establish the TLUD micro-gasifier stoves biochar maker, Paul was aware of the lack of options for making larger quantities of biochar in low-cost user-friendly devices. The right combination of features came together in late 2019 and led to a patent (pending) in 2020. The Rotatable Covered Cavity (RoCC) kiln fills an important gap in the sizes of pyrolytic technology (as described in Anderson s publications). The RoCC kiln technology has been operational in diameters of 2, 3, 4, and  6 feet, with ample justification for substantially larger sizes, as proposed for the Quebec forestry project by Cbiochar.  

The project history is also impacted by the awakening around the world of the need for long-term carbon dioxide removal and the request for proposals by Microsoft of projects such as the one we are proposing. Five years ago there was no concurrence of RoCC kiln technology, Quebec forestry situation and Microsoft financial encouragement.

There are two major threats of reversal:

1) Burning of the created biochar. We mitigate against this by having a short time period and rigorous surveillance between supervised (and documented) production to the biochar being rendered un-burnable. Biochar thinly dispersed into soils is un-burnable so is biochar used in asphalt. Once created and quantified, our char is to be sufficiently damp that it cannot burn without significant drying.

2)  Biochar in soils can undergo very slow decomposition. We estimate the half life to be 500 to 1000 years, well beyond the short timeframe for the World s currently needed carbon removal efforts. ",The compensation would be through a project-level buffer pool. Note that any loss of sequestered carbon (biochar) because of fire prior to the biochar being rendered  un-burnable � would not ever be offered to Microsoft. Our definition of sequestered carbon requires it to be into soil or permanent substances such as asphalt.,"All of the carbon credits in the buffer pool would come from this project.

"Charm Industrial, Inc.",,Geological sequestration of bio-oil,Charm Industrial Bio-Oil Sequestration,Other (specify),"Similar to BECCS, but we convert biomass to bio-oil and inject the oil into geological formations for sequestration.",,,"Charm Industrial’s geological sequestration of bio-oil project began in March of 2020, when we discovered an opportunity to sequester CO2 in the form of bio-oil, an intermediary in our biomass-to-hydrogen process. In our novel process, bio-oil is produced through fast pyrolysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis) of waste biomass, then transported to an injection well, prepared for injection, and pumped underground. In the US these injection wells are typically EPA Class I Industrial Waste Disposal Wells or Class V salt caverns (https://www.epa.gov/uic/general-information-about-injection-wells). The process effectively takes atmospheric CO?, captures it in biomass, converts the biomass to a liquid similar to crude oil but with half the energy content (not economically useful or viable as a fuel), and injects it into rock formations that have securely stored crude oil for hundreds of millions of years.    Since the project’s inception, we’ve studied the constituents and properties of bio-oil alongside the constraints of wells and caverns to determine means of modifying the bio-oil for injection into geological formations. We filed a provisional patent documenting our findings and methods. We’ve also found a suitable well provider, and have kicked off the project of drilling our own injection well co-located with a future bio-oil production plant to limit transport costs and emissions. We are now working through regulatory approvals to classify fast pyrolysis bio-oil as a beneficial reuse material.    The project has been spearheaded by the company’s three founders, Shaun, Peter and Kelly. Shaun’s focus has been on the physical injection and its associated implementation. Peter has been focused on securing initial bio-oil supply, as well as economic studies and pricing. Kelly has been working on developing a larger plant for the expanded volume of bio-oil. If Microsoft pays for carbon removal through Charm, any profits will go directly to the expansion and scaling of our bio-oil production capabilities, helping us come down the cost curve towards scale economies. A long term offtake would also allow us to secure reasonable loans for plant construction of additional capacity, building towards significantly lower costs over time.",,,10/5/2020,Wichita,Kansas,USA,20000,20000,I agree to keep pricing firm for 45 business days,32400,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,No,"This LCA is for the 2020-2022 removals and includes the end-to-end process from bio-oil production to injection, including transport. We do not include the emissions from biomass production, due to the biomass being a residue from agricultural activities. Every 1 tonne of bio-oil we procure contains 1.55 tonnes of CO2e. In the process we emit 0.36 tonnes of CO2e from transport and power usage, for a net sequestration of 1.19 tonnes CO2e per ton of bio-oil.     For this project’s LCA, a few notes:  1. “Bio-oil Production” carbon intensity is based on averages of public information about our bio-oil suppliers, including GREET LCA analyses approved by CARB.  2. “Transport to Well” carbon intensity is based on average rail fuel efficiency and the real transport distance from one of our bio-oil suppliers to one of our injection wells.  3. “Injection” carbon intensity is based on a maximum estimate of injection pumping power. Some wells are gravity-fed and require no power.  4. “Storage” carbon content is based on averages of public information about the typical bio-oil water and carbon content from our suppliers.  5. We’ve validated that (a) the bio-oil procured for this project is excess capacity, so we are not getting bio-oil that would have otherwise replaced fossil fuel burning, (b) the bio-oil procured for this project is produced from biomass that would otherwise have rotted, so we are not getting bio-oil produced from biomass that would have otherwise replaced fossil fuel burning.    For future scaleup we anticipate localizing the bio-oil supply chain, leading to a different life cycle analysis boundary that would begin with the waste biomass. Additionally, future projects will validate that the waste biomass entering the process does not have a legitimate alternative use that would displace fossil fuel burning.    We can provide:  1. Carbon intensity/lifecycle analysis from our bio-oil suppliers and injection partners.  2. Verification of receipt/transport of the bio-oil to our injection site from our bio-oil suppliers.  3. Verification of injection from our injection partners.  4. Lot-sampled bio-oil composition analysis to confirm carbon content.     See additional attached docs for a spreadsheet with the full math behind our life cycle analysis, as well as the Stripe Application we've attached (we were a selected vendor) which also gives additional color on lifecycle analysis.  ",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,10000,n/a,"From a physics perspective, bio-oil is denser than water and brine, and does not decompose into gases or lighter liquids through any known natural process in these wells or geological formations. As a result, the appropriate monitoring is substantially less complex/intense than for supercritical CO? injection and geological storage (unlike bio-oil, supercritical CO? is buoyant on brine/water, and can naturally return to the surface).     That said, we will of course monitor for premature reversals using equipment traditionally built into the wells for leakage monitoring. There are both wellhead and annular monitoring systems that measure both flow and pressure inside the well. We will also maintain strict contracts with any well providers that prevent any of the injected material from being removed for any reason.     We would report reversals to customers who may have purchased them, along with any plans to remedy the issue, and would work with those customers to replace that tonnage that was previously sequestered with Charm’s bio-oil capacity, or equivalent.

By capturing carbon through a liquid medium as opposed to gaseous, you can eliminate the high costs of compression, reduce risks of leakage, and take advantage of new types of gravity-fed wells.     Fast pyrolysis bio-oil has already been produced commercially, with the intent of being sold as an alternative fuel. However, its application as a fuel has never been fully realized as researchers and developers have struggled to deoxygenate and de-water the bio-oil sufficiently for fuel applications. In contrast, high water and oxygen content of bio-oil are not an issue for bio-oil sequestration (the bio-oil will get mixed with water downhole anyways, and we don’t care about oxygen content only carbon content.) This enables us to use and generate otherwise undesirable bio-oil with higher solids content, higher viscosity, higher water content, and higher oxygen content… all of which will make the bio-oil cheaper to produce. We are innovating on the process, required equipment, and operations of fast pyrolysis plants. And even further, the reduced constraints allow us to consider a much broader range of biomass feedstocks including high-ash agricultural residue, not just forestry wood waste.","Class I and V injection wells are subject to strict standards for construction and operation, yielding extremely rare issues with leakage or damage. However, Charm would like to ensure that no negative environmental effects occur from the operation of its injections. In addition to each well’s redundant monitoring for pressure and flow, we plan to complement it with frequent inspections of both active operations and prolonged storage in inactive wells. We take additional precautionary measures in material selection for the well and associated equipment for proper compatibility with our bio-oil and run thorough testing on the bio-oil before planned injection. Quality control measures will help us ensure we have a consistent bio-oil and process as well.     There have been some reports of Class I injection wells causing minor seismic activity. This activity hasn’t been shown to do harm, and we look for sites where the area has relatively stable geological conditions or large-scale existing injection of brine via Class II injection wells that dwarfs our injection volumes. We continue to research the topic to understand the impacts more thoroughly.     Our process does rely on thermal energy for pyrolyzer start-up, potentially from fossil fuel sources, such as natural gas or propane. We seek to use zero-carbon sources throughout the process, such as the combusting of the solid biochar product or the gaseous products of the pyrolysis reaction.

Climate Endowment GmbH & Co. KG,Yes,Afforestation of sustainable plantations to capture carbon and enhance biodiversity,Climate Endowment Forestry Fund,Forestry (removal only),,,Afforestation,"Afforestation of sustainable plantations to capture carbon and enhance biodiversity.
By investing in sustainably managed trees plantations, CE Forestry Fund can help corporates to remove part of their emissions. Our strategy is based on well-established wood end-markets and a long track-record in managing these strategies in New Zealand and Australia. 

In addition to the financial features of the asset class, forestry is recognized as potentially one of the best Impact Investment. To upscale it, CE is bringing a value add that is double:

 ¢ Close relation with Rockstrom and Project Drawdown allows to get access to the last studies and enlighten investment decisions,
 ¢ For the CE Forestry Fund, a Comprehensive Framework is co designed with our forestry partner (The Rohatyn Group) to define the criteria and parameters that will be tracked, audited and reported in order to make good on the pledge to deliver double impact (carbon and biodiversity), and ensuring the projects Do No Significant Harm as per the EU Taxonomy.

The decision to go 100% Greenfield combined with the aforementioned Framework to manage, audit and report CE Forestry Fund s results on carbon and biodiversity, make our proposition unique because:

 ¢ The double Impact delivered by the Fund, including all carbon removals, will be 100% additional (trees will be planted on degraded lands),
 ¢ Sustainable managed forests will become the investment norm for forest investments, and we already incorporated the EU taxonomy methodologies in our sustainability framework, a detailed document with the rules and guidelines for investment selection and operations.
 ¢ Carbon credits generated by CE Forestry Fund will be attractive because they will be traceable, truly green, and be measured against an undisputed baseline.
 ¢ Protecting / Enhancing biodiversity is a  service � that does not cost money, but actually generates money. The sustainability measures are in large part tweaks to operating and planting procedures that have a big impact. 
 ¢ Planting forests is the most efficient way to protect  natural � forests as it increases the offer of wood from sustainably managed forests and reduces the pressure on natural forests with all their important biodiversity. 

By planting trees, CE Forestry fund will generate carbon credits for an extended period. As an evergreen fund, it will aim at replanting trees after each harvest and maximising the durability of the removals under a long-term average carbon accounting method. This combination makes possible to propose Microsoft to offtake a large volume of carbon credits over a long-term horizon. 
","Project design and implementation is the prime responsibility of Climate Endowment and the Rohatyn Group. 

The Climate Endowment:
 ¢	Impact investment expertise
 ¢	Independent verification of additionality and impact
 ¢	Extensive networks within the scientific and NGO community 
 ¢	Deep multi-asset institutional investment experience

The Rohatyn Group:
 ¢	>20 years of timberland investment experience
 ¢	$3.9 billion invested
 ¢	2.2m hectares managed across 8 countries
 ¢	Managed 14 funds and 8 accounts
 ¢	F&A Leadership team with 10+ years of working together

Investment can be done either by an Investment Company managed by CE and TRG, or by a regulated Luxemburg Fund.

The Forestry Fund will be a sub-compartment of the regulated RAIF ( Reserved Alternative Investment Fund �) fund vehicle Nixdorf Capital Impact Fund S.C.S., SICAV-RAIF. 
The regulated Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) for the fund will be Finexis S.A.
The fund s investment advisor will be the Climate Endowment GmbH & Co. KG which will contract with TRG Management LP to be the sub-advisor. 
","Climate Endowment (CE) was born from the common will of seasoned investors to contribute to upscaling Impact Investment to accelerate the transition towards NetZero by 2050 (and earlier if possible). 

Institutional investors that are managing assets on behalf of their policy holders (insurers) or contributors (pension funds) are very conservative and have been slow to reallocate to assets that would significantly lower the carbon footprint of their portfolio. CE founders know that these investors cannot consider investing in impact funds that would not generate a sound sustainable return. 

Up to now, one could find funds invested in real assets that were managed like Private Equity funds by teams mainly focused, with some limited exceptions, on their financial return. CE innovates to go beyond that approach, with two funds: the CE Forestry Fund and the CE Hydropower Fund, which will be managed by combining the stewardship and accountability of the CE team, with the expertise of selected best-in-class asset managers that have a deep expertise of the asset class in which they invest and a good track record. 

For CE Forestry fund, CE decided to partner with TRG (the Rohatyn Group). They have a good track record. They are one of the largest TIMO and they have already invested in New Zealand and Australia.

What CE team brings is the oversight of the implementation of the Sustainability Framework that has been co designed with TRG. In the transition toward Net Zero, investors will get more and more demanding in getting double impact on CO2 and Biodiversity/ SDGs. CE will implement with a stringent attention the needed MRV. There are no commercial large scale forestry funds on the market that have a 100% Greenfield mandate.

Following this methodology there will be an annual audit of the net carbon sequestered by an independent third party.",Yes,,"The Climate Endowment Forestry Fund endeavours to offer an investment opportunity with conservative risk profile, cash distributions (after portfolio ramp-up period), and measurable impact. This is achieved through the characteristics of forestry assets and thanks to the deep specialist forestry experience within the TRG team which will carry out careful portfolio construction and management. TRG s experience and performance across the strategies are key reasons for the selection as strategies under the Climate Endowment Forestry Fund:

-	New Zealand Industrial: 20+ years experience
-	Australia Industrial: 20+ years experience
-	Australia High-Value: 12+ years experience 

Forestry investments have the following risk-reducing characteristics:
 ¢ Inherent in the return profile of timberland is the underlying biological growth of the trees  “ as a result timberland returns have a historically low correlation with capital markets
 ¢ Economic value of timber produced from forestry plantations outpaces the biological growth, as logs shift to higher value product classes, driven by increasing tree diameters.
 ¢ Trees offer the free ability to adapt the duration of the investment by changing the harvest date if timber prices aren t optimal at a target harvest year
 ¢ The Fund offers considerable diversification in terms of genetic, species, and geographic diversification to achieve plantations with strong resilience against pests, diseases and extreme weather conditions resulting from climate change.

The team considers that some of the key risks of a timber investment include: 

Disease Risk: The risk that a new or existing pathogen or insect meaningfully impacts the growth rates of trees. The team seeks to mitigate this risk through thorough due diligence informed by decades of forestry experience, through diversification of the portfolio both geographically and by species, and in some cases, through third-party insurance. The team undertakes regular inventories of the forests, which captures data points related to forest health like disease and pests to monitor these risks.  

Weather and Fire Risk: The risk that a wind, flood, or fire event will destroy timber inventory. This risk is managed through geographic diversification, the selection of sites with lower risks by understanding and applying recent research, and through 3rd party insurance. The team tracks weather data for the properties, such as temperature and rainfall, to monitor the current status of these risks.  Although the team has managed a portfolio over two decades and spanning millions of acres, TRG s actual incurred losses have been very limited.

Market Risk: The risk that market price for the fund's timber is markedly lower than projected. This risk is mitigated by species diversification, and by the focus on species and locations which have access to global markets and thus are not tied to the fortunes of local buyers. Further, timber harvesting (at maturity) can occur over a range of ages. The actual timing can be adjusted to correspond to market cycles. That is, harvest when prices are acceptable to high, stop harvesting and grow further volume and value when prices are less attractive. This harvest optionality has some practical limitations but is none the less a very attractive feature of the timber asset class. It is also worth noting that this harvest optionality is greater for high value niche species such as African mahogany and sandalwood than for core timberland / commodity species such as pine and eucalyptus. The team maintains price databases and regularly reviews a variety of research reports to monitor the market risk.   

Currency Risk: The risk that currency movements negatively impact the fund s income and asset value. These risks are mitigated through the choice of timber species that trade in global markets, and the fact that most of the log sales in client portfolios are conducted in U.S. dollars regardless of the country of origin. The fraction of revenue that is denominated in other currencies is smaller, variable and long-dated, and therefore is often uneconomic to hedge. On the expense side, the team calibrates working capital balances in foreign currencies to the budgeted levels of expenditures in those currencies. Overall, the team expects to see the need for very little permanent currency hedging across the portfolio, however, if there is a contract to purchase or sell a property of a size that is material to the fund, the Investment Committee will consider the costs and benefits of a currency hedge covering the period between signing and closing.
",100,30,"The durability is estimated based on the Carbon Averaging accounting method. Under this method we propose to Microsoft 50% of the carbon captured, maintaining the remaining 50% as a buffer pool. Given the properties are managed for production, the actual carbon pools will vary based on the cycle of harvesting, however the 50% of carbon is the long term average amount of carbon that is captured by the projects at any given time.

Under our ownership, all properties will be managed with a long term view under an open ended structure. This means that we plant the trees, hold them to maturity, harvest, and plant again. This cycle continues. Therefore, physical reversals are of little risk, as any reversal will result in a replanting of that particular area of the site. This does not affect the level of carbon credits as we have embedded a 50% buffer and our management plan is unaffected by reversals.
","Every year our forestry partners will coordinate a detailed forest inventory report. This is very detailed as it is the basis on which the NAV is calculated for investors. We are in the final stages of contracting an independent third party (e.g. large international forestry consulting group, global NGO specialising in climate science research) who will develop a methodology, based on the latest peer reviewed scientific research, to estimate the carbon pools annually. This will include the carbon captured, emissions from activities on the properties, as well as emissions through reversal. This will be subject to an audit annually. This information will be provided annually to every investor (as well as Microsoft) and accompanied by commentary on activities as well as a detailed Impact Report.","Avoidable: all properties are managed for production, so there will be avoidable reversals when the trees reach maturity. However we are managing all properties under a long term management plan which will see all properties replanted after harvest in order to sustain the carbon average of the properties. 

Unavoidable: these risks are primarily mitigated through our partnership with one of the worlds largest Timberland Investment Management Organisations who have been operating for more than 20 years in both Australia and New Zealand. Through their experience and expertise, they are able to mitigate these risks through:

- Climate analysis: forestry is a long-term play and therefore the climate, and changes in climate play a significant role in the growth and yield of the trees. As an example, our partners have found that climate change does not affect all areas equally e.g. the northern part of Australia is becoming hotter AND wetter. These conditions are extremely desirable for African Mahogany which looks to benefit from this change.
- Site selection: greenfield forestry allows for more flexibility with site selection. Sites undergo a detailed DD by our forestry partners in order to assess the risks of flooding, storms, strong winds, and fire
- Dispersal: greenfield plantations are typically acquired and managed in smaller parcels rather than one large property. This creates some separation between plots of land which can help to limit the risk of a weather or biological event
- Portfolio diversification: further to the above, we are targeting a range of strategies and geographies which reduce the overall exposure to localised events.
	
","Under the Carbon Averaging accounting method, we understand there is no reversal compensation due so long as the long term management plan is maintained (e.g. replanting after harvest / reversal). This is as there is about a 50% project level buffer pool for each property.","Under our proposal to Microsoft using the Carbon Averaging, we are proposing around 50% of the expected carbon pool which means there is a 50% buffer.",50%,Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"Ideal outcome is that Microsoft decides to inset  “ invest and own their own plantations which we would manage for them. Benefits for Microsoft include:
-	Biodiversity enhancement
-	Highly traceable
-	Protecting natural forest
-	Improving soil
-	Durability guarantee
-	Price guarantee
-	Positive NPV project that also delivers carbon removal

If the above is not possible then an offtake agreement in which Microsoft has a right to all carbon removals at a fixed price. This fixed price is desirable as we are offering our products to highly conservative institutional investors and through Microsoft s financing we can help to de-risk the investment and support a market failure. Greenfield forestry without the carbon returns does not attract enough investors as they see the risk profile too high as they prefer mature forests. Microsoft will enable investment where the market does not invest. Microsoft will lead the way to very conservative investors.

Maximum is all carbon on offer.
Length of tenure 2050.
Through a commitment from Microsoft, we can approach investors with the new lower-risk offer and raise capital to begin investments into projects immediately. We anticipate it will take 1-2 years for projects to be established and carbon removals to be measured.
","The delivery of credits can vary depending on the growth yield of the properties. Given the greenfield approach, volumes will be relatively low in the early years as the plantations are established. There will also be some lower delivery years due to commercial thinning.

We have offered a fixed price of US$45 per metric ton removed. If Microsoft were to request a portion of the carbon removals offered, or ask for more than the carbon removals offered, we may need to reassess the price/ton.
","Given our project is yet to start, these figures are projections based on the experience and methodology of our forestry partner (more details below). Currently we are in the final stages of contracting an indepedent third party to develop a methodology which will leverage the latest peer-reviewed research to take into account the specific species and geographies under the scope. This methodology will be used by us to calculate the net carbon capture each year and then will be subject to an annuual audit by the third party.

The current projections are based off the following:

- Our partner has utilized available research to develop a method for estimating an asset s carbon dioxide capture potential. This is based on estimating the potential expected carbon storage within the total merchantable yield of a forest resource.
- The total merchantable yield of a forest resource is the total volume of wood that can be harvested and extracted for sale. It does not include the wood volume within the unrecoverable portion of the tree (roots and branches) that remains on site. This method aligns carbon measurement with operational reality.

Step 1: includes projecting the mean annual increment or the future annual recoverable wood flow forecast for an asset using published research and/or measured inventory data. For example purposes, the chart below models the total merchantable yield and annual harvest plan for an actual mid-rotation teak resource in Panama. This is analyzed to derive the annual wood growth rate (net growth plus removals) in m3 for the asset in each future year.

Step 2: converts the annual growth measure (m3) into carbon capture estimates. Our partner utilizes available wood-density research and wood-carbon conversion estimates to convert the  green-volume  from Step 1 into dry volume elemental C-storage. The total CO2 storage is then estimated as a 3.67 multiple of this figure, to account for the total molecular mass of the CO2 that would have been captured from the atmosphere to fix the stored elemental carbon within the recoverable wood volume.

",100000,"Differs by species. NZ Pine: 20.6 metric tons, AU Pine/Euc: 17.5 metric tons, AU Sandalwood: 0.2 metric tons, AU Mahogany: 1.1 metric tons",This starts low due to afforestation and increases over time as the trees grow,"Forests play a vital role in the global ecosystem and have direct and indirect influences throughout the world. As a result, projects in which areas are afforested can have many co-benefits. The main co-benefits identified through our project are:

- Natural forest protection: afforestation sustainable plantations can reduce the pressure of logging on natural forests. From our analysis based on data from the FAO, we estimate that every 1ha of newly established sustainable plantation can protect around 4ha of natural forest.

- Enhancing Global Biodiversity: further to the above point, the WWF estimates that forests are home to 80% of all terrestrial biodiversity. Increasing sustainable plantations (not at the cost of existing forest) is a pathway towards reducing the need to harvest from these natural forests.

- Ecosystem restoration / protection: our project targets 25% of the land base for native forest and vegetation. This will comprise of:
o Ensuring that any existing forest upon acquisition will remain as such, and
o Further establishing areas to be  re-wilded � including riparian zones

- Water stewardship: properties acquired will be marginal lands which have been mostly degraded from intensive agriculture. Part of the management plan of our properties involves using no irrigation and relying on natural conditions to provide the crops with enough to grow. The one exception to this is the Sandalwood properties in the Northern Territory of Australia (roughly 15% of the total project). Forests retain water and play a key role in drought and flood management.

- Sustainable Forestry: One of the forest goals outlined by the United Nations is to increase (i) global tree cover, as well as (ii) the area of forest that is certified. Our project will contribute to both by afforesting around 100,000 ha of productive forest (this excludes the area reserved mentioned above) in which all 100,000 ha will be certified under either the FSC or PEFC certification.

- Livelihoods: Our strategy is to acquire marginal / degraded lands for afforestation. This in turn provides economic growth to the rural economies and communities in which these lands are purchased. This includes the hiring and training of contractors in these regions in the fields of forestry, property management, logging, cartage, seedling nurseries, construction, and various support services. There will also be opportunity to participate in community initiatives to further strengthen the ties with the local communities.

- Green buildings: while it is hard to estimate the exact portion of timber which will be used in construction, we anticipate that there will be a significant percentage of timber from our properties which are used in the construction of commercial and residential buildings. Timber is a carbon negative product compared to carbon intensive cement, steel and glass and has the added benefit of being a carbon sink, potentially remaining so after disposal.

- Silvopasture:For mahogany and sandalwood plantations farmers may have livestock graze on the property. This (i) provides an extra revenue stream, (ii) reduces the need for using pesticides, and (iii) can increase the carbon sequestration of the property. The global sequestration potential of this strategy has been analysed by the research team at Project Drawdown who estimated that it can remove 42GtCO2e by 2050 (Silvopasture | Project Drawdown)

- Benefits to surrounding ecosystems: the nature of a greenfield strategy means that the plots of land will be smaller pockets rather than one large property. This means that the plantations can play a key role in connecting and buffering watersheds and native forest. Therefore, afforestation of depleted land bases improves not only the land base itself, but the local environment. Surrounding native forests species can benefit from this connectivity allowing animal species to access more native forests. Furthermore, native forests can benefit from management actions such as pest control and fire management.

- Improving soil quality: Once a land-base has become fallow, or transforms to desert, there are very few economically viable uses for the land. Timberland is an exception and has the potential to improve the land base and increase biological diversity. The conversion of marginal / degraded land to commercial forestry builds a new sustainable source of organic material for the land base, helps to prevent further erosion, and creates a habitable soil ecosystem for organisms. Much of the alkalinity of the soil is held in the deep roots of perennial plants and trees. When a forest is sustainably harvested, the biological matter is maintained in the soils due to replanting of harvested areas and the time that it takes for roots to degrade. Approximately 90% of the nutrients in a tree is contained in the leaves and small branches which are left on site at harvest time.


Alignment with the UN SDG s:
- All projects selected by the Climate Endowment, are selected based on their inclusion in the Project Drawdown list of Climate Solutions, in this case Tree plantations (on degraded land), with a carbon removal potential of 36 GtCO2e. Project Drawdown s team of researchers have mapped out each of their solutions against the UN SDG s to identify all the benefits and trade-offs of each project.
- Furthermore, we will be leveraging the years of research and development of the IRIS+ metrics developed by the Global Impact Investor Network (GIIN) in collaboration with the scientific community, NGO s and investment stakeholders. These metrics have each been mapped out to the SDG s and specific indicators. We are expecting to assess 30 core metrics and a further 10 additional metrics each year in which we will also be able to map out the contribution to the SDG s.","The co-benefits above have been identified through various sources, including:
- Project Drawdown,
- FAO,
- Rainforest Alliance, and
- Our forestry partners who have been operational in forestry for over 20 years.

While several of these co-benefits may be difficult, or not possible to measure precisely, using current technology, we will seek to engage contractor/s to assist in the measuring and/or developing of a methodology where necessary to measure, or at least estimate with confidence.","Our projects provide economic opportunities to the rural communities in which these projects take place. Our project structure is evergreen meaning that the employment of these people is long-term in nature. The afforestation of these properties is also anticipated to improve the environmental conditions of these areas by adding additional tree cover, improving the biodiversity relative to the previous marginal lands, and improving the soil quality. All employees under contract will be paid a fair compensation for the work on the project.","As Climate Endowment is a European based company, we are subject to legislation such as the EU Taxonomy. This document is positioning itself as the pinnacle of impact investment and includes such checks such as a Do No Significant Harm check. We have used this to establish a checklist in which all projects must pass to be acquired. This includes considerations for waterways, soil, pollution, biodiversity. Humans will not be displaced. We have not found any perverse incentives. New emission sources will be avoided as much as possible and will be estimated as part of the overall carbon forest footprint.

The South African government s UN (SDG) response  includes agriculture targets for SDG 2  which includes the promotion of sustainable agriculture. These are supported by policy documents such as the Agricultural Policy Action Plan (2015 “2019) , the Integrated Growth and Development Plan (2012) , and the Strategic Plan for the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (2015 “2020) .

The project activity has no identified negative impacts on sustainable development. Rather it promotes sustainable agricultural practices, and addresses adaptation to climatic changes and is directly resultant in improved soil quality and carbon stocks.

Climate Robotics Inc.,Yes,"Continuous, In-field Production of Biochar from Agricultural Residues",In-field Biochar Production from Crop Waste,Biochar,,,,"Biochar is charcoal made from the pyrolytic decomposition of biomass waste. When added to agricultural soils, biochar has been shown to increase crop yield, improve water retention, increase fertilizer use efficiency and increase soil pH (Lehmann and Joseph 2015). When produced at temperatures in excess of 500C, with a Hydrogen : Organic Carbon (H:COrg) ratio of less than 0.7, the carbon in biochar is shown to be highly stable in soils for at least 100 years (Budai et al. 2013). When the Oxygen : Organic Carbon (O:COrg) is 0.2-0.6 the biochar is assumed to be stable in soil for 100 - 1,000 years (Spokas 2010). The global annual sequestration capacity from sustainable biochar production is estimated to be well in excess of 1 billion tons of CO2eq (Woolf et al 2009). Despite this long lifespan and global opportunity, a major challenge to scaling biochar production is the cost, and carbon footprint associated with collecting and transporting bulky biomass feedstock.

We have developed, and patented, a tow-behind agricultural implement--similar in design to a planter or harvester--that is moved across agricultural fields to continuously collect and convert agricultural waste biomass into biochar in the field. Agricultural waste biomass is abundant: a typical corn farm produces up to 6 tonnes of waste/acre each year, which has few other economically viable uses. This system design minimizes transportation costs, while ensuring durability of the carbon in soil. Our system also allows for repeated, seasonal applications of biochar, maximizing the long term carbon storage potential of the land.

Our second generation system is towed by a truck or tractor, and can convert approximately one tonne of biomass per hour into biochar. Using an off the shelf forage harvester implement, we harvest approximately 70% of the in-field dry biomass (leaving the remaining fraction for erosion control), and reduce it to a uniform consistency and particle size. We then transfer the biomass to a pre-heating auger (using waste heat from down-stream processes) to dry the materials prior to pyrolysis.

The dried material is then fed into a pyrolytic screw-- a fully-enclosed auger that is heated via magnetic induction. Within the pyrolytic screw, the biomass is subjected to temperatures in excess of 700C, with residence times between 10-30 seconds. As the pyrolytic screw rotates, biomass feedstock is compressed, forming a plug that minimizes oxygen infiltration into the chamber. Temperature, oxygen concentration and residence time are continuously monitored and logged to ensure the biochar is produced according to the proper conditions.

Once produced, the biochar is cooled below autoignition temperature (400C) in a cooling auger via heat sinks and nominal water spraying. The water can serve as a carrier for additives (both elemental and microbial) to functionalize the biochar to meet crop and soil needs (e.g. increase pH buffering capacity of acidic soils). The biochar is then incorporated via a rake, disk or shallow keyline plow into the upper 10cm of topsoil (qualifying as conservation tillage) as the machine moves forward. 

We have partnered Loy Sneary, a private landowner in the Houston, TX area, to develop an agricultural biochar project. Sneary owns over 5,000 acres of agricultural and ranchland, with at least 4 tonnes of suitable biomass feedstock per acre. Climate Robotics will convert the agricultural waste biomass on this land into biochar annually for the duration of the project, generating an annual offset of 2.2 Metric Tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MT CO2eq) per acre.

Payments from Microsoft will cover operating expenses of running the pyrolysis system and ongoing monitoring of the project sites for reversals.
","Climate Robotics  team has over three decades of experience developing and deploying biochar production equipment to farms and forestry operations in all 50 US states and across 6 continents. It s CEO, Jason Aramburu, is a recognized expert in agricultural technology, having previously worked on industrial and agricultural robotic systems for Baidu and Aramco. Its Chief Science Officer, Morgan Williams received his PhD in soil science, and previously co-founded Biochar Solutions, the largest seller of bulk biochar in North America and a Global Pioneer in Richard Branson's Virgin Earth Challenge. CR s lead engineer, Peter Rellinger, has over 30 years of experience designing trailer-mounted industrial systems for companies like Halliburton, Caterpillar and Schlumberger. Climate Robotics works with a network of fabricators in the Houston Area to produce its trailer-mounted agricultural implements. The Company is funded by leading venture capital funds from Silicon Valley including Congruent Ventures, Wireframe Ventures and Grantham Trust.

Climate Robotics (CR) has partnered with Verra (formerly VCS) and Biochar Works to develop the first comprehensive carbon offset methodology for biochar which is expected to be implemented by Q4 2021. CR has also partnered with Loy Sneary and the Sneary Cattle Company, a large private landowner in the Houston, TX area. Sneary has over 5,000 acres of agricultural and ranch land available for conversion of waste biomass into biochar. Finally, CR works together with Professors Sergio Capareda and Eunsung Kan at Texas A&M University s (TAMU) Agrilife extension. TAMU will provide ongoing biochar characterization and soil sampling services to Sneary and Climate Robotics to provide independent verification of the carbon stability and agronomic benefits of the biochar.","Climate Robotics was founded in 2020 by Jason Aramburu and Morgan Williams PhD. The two co-founders designed and built multiple generations of prototype of CR s technology, before raising $4.2mm in venture capital in March 2021, in a round led by Congruent Ventures. VC funding has been used to develop and test the company s pyrolysis equipment, and to select and validate the proposed project site. CR was introduced to Loy Sneary by a mutual connection in early 2021. Mr Sneary is a generational landowner with over 5,000 acres of agricultural land in the Houston, TX area. Mr. Sneary is passionate about fighting climate change and has been seeking a way to verifiably sequester atmospheric carbon in the soils of his lands for a duration of at least 100 years. In June 2021 Sneary and CR agreed to collaborate on development of a large-scale carbon project using CR s biochar production equipment. Sneary will allow free and clear use of the land, and make it available to CR and its partners for ongoing maintenance and monitoring. Climate Robotics will own and operate its biochar production equipment, and will process biomass sourced from Sneary s land each year. Climate Robotics will be responsible for collecting and aggregating data regarding the carbon offset on each acre of land, and will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of reversals for the duration of the removal credit. Professors Sergio Capareda and Eungsung Kan at Texas A&M University s Agrilife Extension will provide ongoing 3rd party support to characterize the biochar produced by CR, and conduct soil sampling tests to verify the stability of the carbon. TAMU s fees will be paid out of the overall project budget.

We are only claiming removal credits as biochar. We leverage the new Verra Carbon Standard (VCS) methodology for biochar which is expected to be approved by Q4 2021. This methodology assumes that feedstock is normally left in field to decay or combusted, which represents the majority of agricultural waste feedstocks.",Yes,Verra (VCS),,N/A,,,Yes,,"Manufacturing Risk: We expect that we can deliver the entirety of the FY 22 removals with a single unit of our pyrolysis system which is currently operational. In order to deliver the removals offered in FY 23 and beyond, Climate Robotics will need to manufacture and deploy up to 10 additional pyrolysis systems. Low volume manufacture of heavy equipment can be challenging, however our team has a combined 50 years experience manufacturing mobile heavy equipment for the energy and carbon sequestration industries. We have a network of suppliers in Houston, TX with sufficient capacity to produce the units on time and meet our goals.

Methodology Risk: We are members of the biochar working group that is drafting and developing a comprehensive methodology for biochar credit verification with Verra Carbon Standard (VCS). The methodology is currently in a draft form, and is out for public comment. We expect that the methodology will be approved as-written in Q4 '2021. We are designing the project in accordance with methodology as it is currently written. It is possible that this could take longer than expected, or that the methodology could change. If so, Climate Robotics will adjust its targets accordingly.

Feedstock availability: Climate Robotics and its partner landowners have offered over 5,000 acres for biochar production and sequestration across the lifespan of the project. We expect to source 100% of our feedstock from this acreage as corn stover, wheat straw and other crop wastes. It is possible that due to adverse weather conditions some or all of this acreage may not produce sufficient feedstock for biochar production. In those cases, Climate Robotics will source feedstock from its network of over 1,000 farms and forestry operations across the United States and will bear all associated costs.
",1000,200,"The durability of biochar in soil has been estimated to range from decades to in excess of 4,000 years (Krusakov et al 2014) depending on processing and feedstock conditions.  As previously discussed, H:COrg and O:COrg ratios are widely accepted as indicators of biochar stability and have been adopted by the European Biochar Certification (EBC) and Internal Biochar Initiative (IBI) Certification methodologies. The durability term of the biochar produced from Climate Robotics equipment is based on these ratios and published degradation factors. Samples of Climate Robotics biochar (including Corn Stover) have been tested by third party labs and exceed EBC and IBI long term stability criteria.

The measurement of the actual biochar that remains in the soil after application is not a reliable method to estimate the degradation rate because a fraction can be lost through erosion, bioturbation or deep migration into the soil profile over time (Wang et al., 2016).  While these processes may represent a loss of biochar from the field (with potential impacts to the soil benefits of biochar application including nutrient and water efficiencies) they do not represent a loss of carbon sequestration. When biochar is moved down to subsoils through bioturbation, stability is likely to increase compared to storage in the topsoil (Larenc & Lal, 2014). Any biochar lost through erosion and runoff will eventually end up in ocean or lake sediments (Budai et al., 2012), and these low oxygen environments will increase the mean residence time (MRT) of the biochar (Wang et al., 2016). Budai et al. (2013) conclude that the translocation of biochar from the field where it is applied does not threaten the carbon sink potential.

Based on the above, Climate Robotics has adopted modeled degradation factors based on the long-term decay of labile organic carbon in biochar compared to the stable organic carbon fraction, or 2-pool method (e.g. Leng et al., 2019), as well as the decay factor cited in the Verra Carbon Standard Methodology. CR has incorporated these decay factors into the claimed removal.  Based on these models, and measured H:COrg and O:COrg values, we guarantee that the net removal claimed will remain sequestered at 200 years post application.","In-field monitoring is not an accurate means to quantify sequestered biochar stability in a single field given various natural mobility factors (e.g. bioturbation and erosion) that do not reduce carbon sequestration.  As a best management practice, Climate Robotics does collect soil core samples (to a depth of 3 ft) from project locations prior to treatment, and at periodic intervals post application to monitor soil edaphic properties and estimate losses to other carbon pools. Climate Robotics also engages with academic partners and industry groups to account for advancements in biochar stability science.  Archived biochar samples are retained by Climate Robotics and may be used to periodically perform carbon stability audits given new technologies or methodologies adopted by carbon verification agencies at the request of legacy carbon offset buyers.  Should these audited samples result in new/lower estimations of carbon stability, Climate Robotics will endeavor to negotiate partial reimbursement for lost carbon.

Prairie fire may result in the volatilization of shallow biochar to carbon dioxide and does represent a potential reversal; though prairie fires generally result in low temperature impacts to soils below 5cm. In the event of a fire on a project property, Mr Sneary will notify Climate Robotics with GPS coordinates of the affected area. The buyer will then be notified, and a monitoring effort undertaken to compare post fire soil core data to the most recent pre-fire soil core data to estimate total carbon losses, if any. Satellite data will also be used to determine total fire impacts. Climate Robotics will share data with offset buyers to develop a suitable remedy should any reversal be suspected. 
","Common best management practices for production farming (e.g. conservation tillage, dedication of some residues for soil protection when fallow, etc) will be maintained.  No additional management efforts will be required. Fire may increase mobility risks and efforts to reduce prairie fire risk including excess brush removal will be coordinated with property owners. In addition to fire mitigation efforts, VCS recommends that biochar be incorporated to a depth of 6-inches to mitigate risk of volatilization through fire. Climate Robotics will meet this depth target, and Mr. Sneary will write a letter attesting to this upon its independent verification.","We are confident that the mitigation measures cited significantly reduce and possibly eliminate the risk of a reversal (both intentional and unintentional). In the event a reversal is confirmed, we will offer the Buyer a clawback provision to receive a credit or payment for the tonnage of CO2 lost to reversals.
",No buffer pool will be developed in 2022. Pools will be available in future years from other projects. One hundred percent of credits in future buffer pools will be removal tons.,"As a general rule, we are committed to a 2-4% contribution of individual project credits to buffer pools, depending on project specific variables through 2026. In 2026, an assessment will be made based on 5 years of production, monitoring, and market data to determine if percentages are adequate or need to be altered.",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Our ideal outcome is to secure an offtake agreement from Microsoft through at least FY 2026. A multi-year agreement will allow us to finance and scale up the manufacture of our mobile pyrolysis systems. There are currently few, if any, reliable mobile pyrolysis systems on the market for biochar producers. By scaling up manufacturing of our system, we can supply our own projects as well as those of other biochar producers. A multi-year agreement with Microsoft would be instrumental in growing the overall biochar industry and increasing the availability of reliable, mobile pyrolysis equipment.

While we would prefer at least a five-year offtake agreement, we would nonetheless be delighted to secure an offtake agreement from Microsoft for any duration (including only FY22). The minimum annual volume we would consider would likely be 300 tonnes of CO2 eq, as this would be necessary to cover the fixed costs associated with establishing the project and delivering our equipment. The maximum volume we would consider would be 10,000 tonnes per year. This upper limit is based on the total size of the project site, (over 5,000 acres), and the volume of biomass we can reliably capture. It would be feasible to deliver a larger volume by leveraging additional project sites in our network pending confirmation with landowners. We would hope to arrange such an agreement within the next 12-18 months once we have delivered on our FY22 commitments. 
","We are able to reduce the price per ton of CO2e for longer term offtake agreements as these longer-term agreements will allow us to secure more favorable equipment financing terms, which reduce our daily operating expenses.",,,,,"On most commercial farms today, crop wastes such as corn stover and wheat straw are collected for removal or disposal or tilled under via tractor and tilling machine. Tilling provides little agronomic benefit, and is utilized for fire, pest and pathogen management. By converting crop waste into biochar, Climate Robotics reduces waste and converts a zero or negative value material into a valuable product with agronomic benefits. Biochar also reduces soil bulk density, which is shown to have a positive impact on reducing topsoil loss and erosion. ","We measure the agronomic benefits of biochar through periodic in-field soil sampling and testing of bulk density, soil pH, and levels of macronutrients. ","In the Southern United States, most farms under 5,000 acres in size are family-owned. Family farm margins are often in the single digit dollars per acre, and sometimes even negative. Many of these farms are also owned or staffed by underrepresented minorities. At Climate Robotics, we are leveraging our biochar production technology to create new value and revenue streams for farmers and landowners. By converting their crop waste into biochar, these farmers can increase the overall value of their land through increased agronomic performance and carbon sequestration. We believe the growth of the biochar market will have a dramatic impact on the economics of a typical family farm, creating new potential revenue streams for underserved farmers, which leads to additional job creation. In addition, Climate Robotics expects to train and employ up to 30 tractor and heavy equipment operators to run its systems. By providing advanced skills training to these operators, Climate Robotics will allow them to develop new careers in soil carbon sequestration.","A small amount of agricultural waste can be useful when left in the field as cover, to protect the soil surface and seedlings from inclement weather. To mitigate any potential harm, Climate Robotics typically harvests a maximum of 2/3 of the total mass of crop waste found in a typical acre of soil. The remaining 1/3 is left in-field to decompose, where it shields the soil surface from rain, snow and other inclement weather.

The Climate Robotics biochar reactor can be powered using 480V 3-phase shop electricity, or an onboard diesel generator. When a diesel generator is used, the associated emissions are accounted for and represent less than 15% of the total CO2 sequestered. Climate Robotics systems meet or exceed all local and state-level air quality regulations within the State of Texas.

There is some evidence that the use of heavy agricultural machinery like large tractors can lead to soil compaction, which suppresses yields and contributes to runoff. CR's system can be operated using a lighter weight tractor or other piece of agricultural machinery. In addition, under normal circumstances, crop waste is typically collected or tilled under using this same machinery. As a result, any soil compaction or emissions associated with the use of a tractor would be observed regardless.",,,,,,
ClimateCare Oxford Ltd.,,Pioneering Peruvian Agroforestry and Reforestation Project with Issued CDRs,Jubilación Segura: Agroforestry and Reforestation with small-scale Farmers in Peru,Afforestation/reforestation,,,,"Jubilacion Segura is a grouped afforestation and reforestation project initiated by PUR Projet in the San Martin region of Peru, within the Amazon Andean foothill forest. The Project addresses widespread deforestation caused by the expansion of agriculture due to international demand, degraded lands and low farmer income. The San Martin region is the most degraded region of Peru and is being deforested at a rate of 67,000ha/year. A root cause of this deforestation is the cycle of poverty that forces farmers to make the choice between forest conservation and family income.     This project realizes that agricultural production does not need to degrade ecosystems and can instead regenerate them. Jubilacion Segura, which means secure and happy retirement, supports farmers to develop diversified agroforestry systems and restore degraded lands through afforestation.     PUR Projet is the Project designer and manages the CDR monitoring and evaluation, farmers participate through their cooperatives or local organizations in the promotion of the development of co-products value chain, the securing of land tenure, and the national and international recognition of their contribution. Reforested areas are the farmers’ land (average farm size 1ha/farmer) Land-use before reforestation can be perennial crops (cocoa, coffee, orange, etc.), annual crops (corn, rice, etc.), abandoned land or land in rotations with annual crops (“purmas”), pastures. The reforested zones are located outside of any conservation area have not been deforested over the past 10 years and does not fall under the definition of forests.     Since 2010, PUR Projet has supported over 2,600 farmers to restore 2,671 ha of land and plant over 1.6 million trees. This Project is certified under the Voluntary Carbon Standard and timber harvesting is certified under the Forestry Stewardship Council Certification. Trees planted support CDR, and there is a plan to plant 150,000 trees per year until 2040.  Not included in this project, but adjacent, is a 300,000 ha conservation project that PUR Projet manages. This conservation Project, called Martin Sagrado, supports greater landscape-level impact, and Jubilacion Segura contributes to the restoration surrounding an important Biosphere.

",PUR Projet’s technical forms aim to gather as much field data as possible in a way that is accessible to field personnel and based in field realities.,"This Project aims to reduce and account for any CO2 Emissions related to the Project. According to the VCS methodology AR-AMS007/version 0.31, Section 5.5 the GHG emissions resulting from the project (including removal of herbaceous vegetation, combustion of fossil fuel, fertilizer application, use of wood, decomposition of litter and fine roots of N-fixing trees, construction of access roads within the project boundary) are minimal and therefore accounted as zero.  PUR Projet has signed on to the Net Zero goal as a B-Corp and insets any travel through our project activities.     Another potential risk is the minority of farmers without land tenure documentation. While 80% of farmers do have formal documentation recognizing their rights to the land, there is still a risk with the 20% of farmers farm without formal documentation. To mitigate the risk and increase even the project’s benefits to the farmers, the project has initiated a land titling process called CUSAF (Cesion en Uso para Sistemas Agroforestales). As a first step, a contract was signed in 2011 between Acopagro and the Titling department of San Martin Regional Government (ex-COFOPRI) for the prioritization of land titling for the farmers in the area of influence of the project in San Martin. As a result of this ongoing process, several thousand land titles were registered between 2013 and 2018 in the project area. The process is long and complex since it involves several public Peruvian institutions, in a changing political context, and efforts of project entities will continue in the coming years. In addition, and to ensure more benefits to the farmers and legality of timber logging, the project is supporting registration of plantations (ARA, “registro de plantaciones”).",,,,,,,

CO.L.A.FOR looks after the arrangement of sustainable forest cuts, cleaning and maintenance of the woodlands and works in valorising and highlighting the assets of these regions.
The areas under our management are of high environmental and biological value and are part of three national natural parks, Sites of Community Importance (SIC) and UNESCO sites due to them being the oldest beech forests in Europe. 
The idea behind the project  Bosco Amico � is to sell Carbon Credits obtained through voluntary compensatory interventions.
The method chosen is the  skip the shift � that is the selection of an area to be preserved and which will not be cut for the next 10 years, this will ensure that there isn t CO2 emission given by the removal of wood from the forest and that there is an increase in carbon uptake and fixation over time.
The scientific calculation model used is the COFIX of the EFI (European Forest Institute) which is also commonly used by the main Italian public bodies (ISPRA, SISEF) and the main certificatory makers (FSC and PEFC). 
This model shows and average increase in the absorption of CO2 made by the forest of 288 mtCO2eq per hectare in the case of CONSV scenario (by no cutting forests).

ConserWater Technologies Inc.,Yes,Improve SOC by promoting rotational grazing in Mexican grasslands.,Grassland Restoration in Northern Mexico,Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"The key stakeholders or major participants are lower-income rural communities that collectively own lands, known as ""Ejidos"", which are a classic example of the tragedy of the commons. The arid regions of northern Mexico are now under threat from a variety of anthropogenic causes, particularly overgrazing. Overgrazing occurs when plants are subject to heavily intensive grazing from livestock, leading to severe loss of vegetation. This unsustainable ranch management by pastoralists throughout the region has led to severe land degradation, desertification and loss of soil carbon, resulting in CO2 emissions. And when they become unable to sustain their livelihoods on their degraded ranches, ranchers are sometimes forced to sell their land to farmers who convert the grasslands into croplands, resulting in further CO2 emissions. In addition, it represents a significant loss of habitat for the fauna of the region, coupled with the replacement of the natural flora with crops. According to researchers at Cornell University, if the current trends in cropland conversion are continued, the grasslands of the Chihuahua desert will completely disappear by 2025. In this project, we work with ranchers who raise livestock on individually-owned or community-owned grasslands and enable those ranchers to adopt improved grazing practices. These practices include rotational grazing, wherein livestock are rotated between different sections of a pasture over the course of months or years, while other sections of the pasture are allowed to rest. These sections are known as  paddocks �. This practice allows plants to recover and grow in the paddocks that are allowed to rest, and thus allows them to sequester carbon, gradually regenerating the land. In addition, the regenerated lands become much less likely to be converted to croplands. This will improve flora and fauna of the arid regions of northern Mexico. The livelihoods of the communities utilizing these ranches are also improved  “ both directly through the carbon credit payments and indirectly through substantial improvements to their land quality. 

Boomitra s business model inherently incentivizes all parties involved in executing the project. The farmers/ranchers are always guaranteed to receive the majority of the credit value as per our company policy. Then, the ground staff and other supporting parties are also paid a commission between 10-20% depending on their role in enabling and supporting farmers to generate carbon removal. The remainder (~20%) is Boomitra s institutional expense for project development, sustained long-term project monitoring,  3rd party validation and verification expenses, issuance expenses etc.","Boomitra has a balanced team to help cover many different aspects of the project execution, and is central to the overall management and governance of the project. Boomitra s carbon project development team has individuals with 10+ years of experience successfully getting dozens of carbon projects 3rd party validated and verified with a variety of international standards from CDM to Gold Standard. Boomitra s geospatial data science team includes individuals with 5+yrs experience in extracting actionable information from satellite data sources throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Boomitra s farmer success teams ensure that all of the farmers  questions and concerns are answered and that the farmers are efficiently recruited. This team is also supported by software innovations from the software development team that continually make it easier for farmers to participate in the program. For example, advising the farmers on best carbon practices may be done by the farmer success team automatically through the Boomitra app downloaded by the farmers.
These efforts directly managed by Boomitra are further complemented by trained ground staff teams from our partner organizations. The partner organizations are entities with proven expertise in working with farmers and encouraging behaviour change at a massive scale. Most of our partners have well equipped team having good relationship with the farmers/ranchers and indirect stakeholders. The ground staff from these organizations are trained in both the kinds of behaviours that lead to increases in soil carbon and also in Boomitra s farmer recruitment procedures. These staff advise farmers and ranchers on best practices through group workshops and one-on-one advising. Our partner organizations, through their ground staff, are instrumental in securing the carbon, environmental and biodiversity benefits through interaction with farmers. 

Some of our major ground partners in northern Mexico are Pronatura (Mexico s largest environment NGO, http://pronatura.org.mx/), Pasticultores del Desierto (http://www.pasticultoresdeldesierto.com/), Yara  (world s largest fertilizer company and our investor, https://www.yara.com/) etc. All of them are organizations with significant experience in working with farmers at a 100,000+ acre scale.

Since 2016, Boomitra has worked with thousands of farmers across the globe helping them to adopt new
Innovative technologies and gain better returns from minimum investments. ","Boomitra s ground partners have been working on encouraging sustainable agriculture/grassland as a means to improve soil health and create carbon sequestration for many years prior to working with Boomitra. Boomitra has developed the key technology components required for the project, including the measurement of soil carbon to 30 cm depth and apps and interfaces for farmer enrolment in the time period from 2018 to mid-2020.

Boomitra connected with the first ground partner in Mexico, Pronatura, in mid-2020 around developing a carbon project and expanding their existing efforts in encouraging to rotational grazing to convince more ranchers, including communal ranches, to adopt it with the creation of financial payments. Later on, the other partners were also added in a similar capacity (Eg. Yara in Jan 2021, Pasticultores in July 2021 etc.). The current efforts associated with the project are fully financed internally by Boomitra and the individual ground partners. Workshops for the ranchers are held regularly and local stakeholder consultations are held whenever communities are enrolled. As lands are enrolled, there is typically a 2-step process of Boomitra engaging with any ground partner. First, a ground partner brings a small subset of farmers for initial evaluation and Boomitra produces a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) soil carbon analysis. This analysis will enable us to choose the farmers for recruitment across an entire geographical region. This process is important because prior literature data does not exist about the sequestration that is possible in any given region with a given set of practices adopted for most parts of the world. This step started with a PoC analysis we did with Pronatura in early 2021. Once we calculate that data for a small subset, we have tangible values of what is possible for a farmer/rancher to achieve and then it is much easier to convince farmers to sign up and complete a larger scale farmer recruitment. The large-scale farmer recruitment is the second step where we work closely with ground partners, and is usually preceded by MoUs and project contracts between Boomitra and the partner. Large scale recruitment is an ongoing process throughout a projects  lifetime.

The identified project location is under threat from a variety of anthropogenic causes, particularly overgrazing. Overgrazing occurs when plants are subject to heavily intensive grazing from livestock, leading to severe loss of vegetation. This unsustainable ranch management by pastoralists throughout the region has led to severe land degradation, desertification and loss of soil carbon, resulting in net CO2 emissions.


Boomitra has developed a proper multi-level grievance address model to handle any grievances arising out during the project cycle. This is one of the key requirements to be met as per the global standards. This grievance address mechanisms are discussed in the all the stakeholder consultations.

Now, in Aug/Sep 2021, we (Boomitra) are preparing for project listing on the VCS registry, followed by project design documentation and monitoring report completion in Nov 2021 for 3rd party validation and verification.",6/1/2017,Chihuahua,Chihuahua,Mexico,256000,2560000,"No (Note: Marking ""no"" does not influence whether your proposal will be accepted)",80000,720000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,100000,900000,80,100,Not Applicable,Yes,Verra (VCS),,N/A,,,Yes,,"1.	There is a possibility that ranchers might go back to traditional grazing practices due to external pressure from their own community. Certain practices are traditional to that community.

3.	Conversion of the grasslands to croplands or built environments.  

Our methodology of choice, VM0042, assumes no leakage, given that various aspects of the methodology are met:
1.	There are no statistically significant changes in livestock numbers relative to the baseline with the implementation of the activities, so leakage due to livestock displacement is unlikely
2.	For the practices being implemented, academic literature suggests that significant sustained yield decreases are unlikely
3.	For any manure used in any scenario with any farmer/rancher/landowner, the manure either comes from livestock that is already included in the project, or shown to be diverted from anaerobic decomposition - thus no leakage from manure usage is present
The above are the key leakage scenarios in project.",100,0,"We try to guarantee a durability term of 100 years (and Verra requires at least 30 years of monitoring for their minimum project longevity). This is accomplished through a variety of means, but mostly entails farmers maintaining consistently their practices and adopting new ones, avoiding reversals. We significantly mitigate durability risk by working with trusted and highly regarded local ground partners who truly understand their communities and can ensure practices are maintained - with our projects, it is the ground partners who are directly involved in helping farmers to transition and maintain regenerative practices, and working with trusted partners ensures the impact can continue long term. Furthermore, to keep the farmers' interests aligned, we vest carbon credit payments to the farmers over a period of 5 years to ensure farmers maintain practices. Additionally, with our technology  we are able to continuously monitor soil carbon levels perpetually at very low cost - more data equates to better ability for us to ensure soil carbon is safely stored through targeted interventions as necessary. You, as a buyer, are also able to view these in real time through our dashboards. Despite these tools put in place, there is still some residual permanence risk that exists (which can never truly reach 0), and we keep a buffer pool based on conservatively estimating that risk and using accepted VCS tools.

The only source of revenue for these ranchers comes from the products their livestock produce: milk, meat etc. Many come from very poor communities where the community collectively owns the land (known as ""Ejidos"") for the purposes of sustenance of the community. These ranchers do not derive any immediate direct benefits from implementing regenerative grazing and thus do not have a strong incentive to do it without carbon finance. With carbon finance, the ranchers and their communities are able to get direct cash payments through the carbon credits, and these enable them to adopt and maintain regenerative grazing practices. Regenerative grazing requires more concerted work than regular grazing because the lands have to be carefully divided into paddocks and the status of the paddocks has to be monitored as the livestock are carefully cycled. The carbon finance provides the monetary incentives to make it happen, at scale. 

Furthermore, these ranchers are not often fully aware of the kinds of practices that lead to carbon sequestration, because they may come from poorer communities with significant barriers in access to knowledge. Some of the communities are even largely illiterate. The carbon financing also enables these barriers to be crossed by financing the educational activities (by our ground partners) to teach the ranchers the best possible practices.","1.	Project level buffer pools exist for use in the case of reversals, and these are calculated based on risk analysis of real risks of soil carbon in our projects, in addition to VERRA's standard AFOLU non-permanence tool

4.	We offer a real-time dashboard to our major clients, which allows them to use our soil carbon measurement technology to directly monitor the carbon sequestered by farmers, in almost real-time. The sequestration levels of every farmer incentivized by the client may be updated on a weekly basis on the dashboard and viewed by the client. Soil carbon levels regularly experience fluctuations throughout a season. However, if a statistically significant drop in the real sequestration level is seen, then the client can be immediately alerted about the potential reversal. ","This is the first of its kind project in the area. No other project is currently under consideration by any global project proponent under VM0042. So the risks involved from similar projects have been ruled out. Yes, in the future, other organisations may come with similar projects which will directly reduce these risks.
Risks
The major risk identified under this project is that the land use could change from the grassland to cropland. As per the methodology such land use change is not permitted in the project scenario. The status quo involves some amount of grassland to cropland conversion occurring due to the poor profitability of the grasslands  “ one of the aims with carbon finance is to realign the incentives to avoid this conversion. Another minor risk identified is that the ranchers could go back to traditional practices (intensive overgrazing) due to cultural compulsions prevailing in the area. This risk is mitigated by working with trusted ground partners who have already worked with farmers/ranchers on behaviour change at scale. For example, our partners in Mexico include Mexico s largest environmental NGO and the world s largest fertilizer company. These organizations are highly trusted in local communities and enable the farmers to sustain their behaviour change once a farmer starts working with us.
Climate change also presents increased risks of severe weather, which are difficult to mitigate. Fires, pests and extreme weather conditions may result in reversals which are beyond the control of the project. 
Boomitra is employing the latest VM0042 methodology from VCS to estimate overall CDRs from the project. As per the methodology, a project-level buffer needs to created and the number of buffer credits to be contributed to the AFOLU pooled buffer account must be determined by applying the latest version of the VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool. This tool accounts for possibilities of direct and indirect (avoidable/unavoidable) reversal which may result in the reversal of CDRs. Hence, the project is capable of tackling the risks resulting from reversal with buffer credits available with VCS.
Boomitra, along with its trusted partners, will develop a robust monitoring plan to mitigate or avoid risks associated within the project. Community awareness programs and capacity building programs through training especially target the youth and women in the region.","As described earlier, project level buffer pools exist for use in the case or reversals, and these are calculated based on risk analysis of real risks of soil carbon in our projects, in addition to VERRA s standard VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence risk tool.

ConserWater Technologies Inc.,No,Improve SOC through sustainable agriculture practices in the Indo-Gangetic plain,Regenerative Agriculture in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"Nearly three-quarters of the rural Indian population is dependent on agriculture and its allied sectors  The project activities are various forms of regenerative agriculture practices that are newly adopted in order the sequester CO2. Since each farmer is an independent actor, the exact package of practices adopted by each farmer varies.

The key stakeholders are smallholder farmers from Indo Gangetic Plains. Ever growing population pressure has increased the demand of food which intensified synthetic fertiliser usage in the region. An intensive agricultural process focused on maximizing yields every year has led to a gradual degradation of the soils of the region, resulting in CO2 emissions from the lost soil carbon. Additionally, certain highly unsustainable practices have become mainstream in recent decades, such as the burning of crop residues ( stubble burning �) as an effective way to clear out fields for planting for the next season, which occurs in quick succession after the previous season. Burning crop residues can cause further soil degradation by not only denying the soil of carbon additions but also inadvertently incinerating some of the carbon that is already in the soil, resulting in net GHG emissions. 

In this context, regenerative agriculture provides the opportunity and the power to reverse this land degradation and return carbon to the soil, creating GHG removal. Farmers working with us adopt a variety of regenerative agriculture practices including but not limited to: avoided stubble burning; crop residue management; precision fertilizer management and other sustainable agriculture land management practices. These practices are proven ways to increase soil carbon and enable farmers to also improve their productivity in the future: increases in soil carbon improve the soils  ability to store moisture and nutrients, and thus also help to increase yields in the future. Furthermore the financial benefits from carbon credits would provide a direct boost to the livelihoods of these farmers, many of whom are small and marginal farmers, as mentioned earlier.

The identified project location is under threat from a variety of anthropogenic causes, particularly stubble burning. Stubble burning is one of the contributors to the global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Farmers in the region practice stubble burning to clear the farming land after the completion of harvesting. This is one of the tradition land preparation practices followed by a farmer in land preparation after harvesting of Paddy/Wheat. This method is the cheapest and fastest way of clearing lands for next cropping season. Hence this is practice is widely followed in the Indo-Gangetic Plain.  This has created huge problem in recent years by increasing the Carbon footprint of the crop cycle thereby increasing the GHG emission and soil degradation, which led to various health issues not only in and around the burning fields but also at distance places. Various Government initiatives to curb this practice have failed and still farmers are continuing to burn stubble. 

Currently, farmers are using chemical fertilisers beyond the recommended levels. This intensive farming has led to degradation of soil chemically, physically and biologically post green revolution. This is type of intensive fertiliser farming neither good for farmer nor for crop land. Over the last century, agriculture in the region has undergone a dramatic shift towards intensification. Since the major countries of the region gained independence in the late 1940s, yields of all staple crops have seen a several-fold increase . This increase was necessary to feed a growing population, but at the same time, it led to an increase of 150 kg per hectare in the amount of synthetic fertilizer applied to farms, along with similar increases other crop inputs.

Increase in the temperature results in the loss of SOC as well. Stubble burning increases the soil temperature which burns the essential nutrients inside the soil and kills the important microorganisms in the soil. This will lead to increase in use of chemical and synthetic fertilisers to improve crop yields. Once again soil is exposed to further chemical reaction resulting in loss of micro nutrients and microorganisms. This is an additional burden on farmer to improve soil fertility artificially by applying fertilisers. Global temperatures are also rising day by day. As per 2020 Global Climate Report from NOAA, National Centers for Environmental Information, 2020 was the globally 2nd  warmest year on record. Climate change hits poor the most. It is not easy for a farmer to adopt to these climate changes with new practices and technologies. This is because of two important reasons: financial stability of the farmer and lack of knowledge about the new practices  adoptability. Hence, farmer continuous to practice conventional farming in his land which eventually degrade soils (loss of SOC) to a great extent.     

 
In this context, regenerative agriculture provides the opportunity and the power to reverse land degradation and return carbon to the soil, creating GHG removal. Therefore, the proposed project identifies the need of curbing stubble burning and promote better sustainable land management and agriculture practices through which further soil degradation can be avoided.

We significantly mitigate durability risk by working with trusted and highly regarded local ground partners who truly understand their communities and can ensure practices are maintained - with our projects, it is the ground partners who are directly involved in helping farmers to transition and maintain regenerative practices, and working with trusted partners ensures the impact can continue long term. Furthermore, to keep the farmers' interests aligned, we vest carbon credit payments to the farmers over a period of 5 yrs to ensure farmers maintain practices. Additionally, with our technology we are able to continuously and perpetually monitor soil carbon levels at very low cost - more data equates to better ability for us to ensure soil carbon is safely stored through targeted interventions as necessary. You, as a buyer, are also able to view these in real time through our dashboards. Despite these tools put in place, there is still some residual permanence risk that exists (which can never truly reach 0), and we keep a buffer pool based on conservatively estimating that risk and using accepted VCS tools.

The vast majority of farmers in this region are small and marginal growers , and they do not have access to much information on improved agricultural practices. Their small size also leads to very tight margins, making it difficult for them to experiment with new practices. Thus there are both financial and knowledge-based barriers for the farmers in their adoption of the project activities. Certain practices require the purchase/rent and use of specialized equipment/tools/crop inputs and incentives typically do not exist for the rent of the equipment (in rare instances, incentives may exist for capital purchases, but these are not very commonplace and still do not cover costs of operation/rental). For example, the avoidance of stubble burning requires the use of an array of potential tools, some mechanical and some biological, representing an initial investing required by the farmer to work towards increasing soil carbon. The full price of these tools are not subsidized through any other sources (including government subsidies) . Thus, this is a significant barrier leading to very low adoption of these equipment/tools/inputs. The carbon financing also enables these barriers to be crossed by financing the educational activities (by our ground partners) to teach the farmers the best possible practices.","1.	Project level buffer pools exist for use in the case of reversals, and these are calculated based on risk analysis of real risks of soil carbon in our projects, in addition to VERRA's standard VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence tool

2.	We have a global portfolio of projects that continues to grow, so if any one project experiences difficulties we can provide real removals from another project very fast. 

3.	It is mandatory for project developer to use VERRA's standard VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence tool as per VM0042. Boomitra will set aside certain portion of the issuance in buffer pool
4.	We offer a real-time dashboard to our major clients, which allows them to use our soil carbon measurement technology to directly monitor the carbon sequestered by farmers, in almost real-time. The sequestration levels of every farmer incentivized by the client may be updated on a weekly basis on the dashboard and viewed by the client. Soil carbon levels regularly experience fluctuations throughout a season. However, if a statistically significant drop in the real sequestration level is seen, then the client can be immediately alerted about the potential reversal. ","Risks
1.	There are new projects coming up in the identified project boundary. All them are in nascent stages of developing technical documents required for registration. Risks associated with such upcoming projects are quite possible. Hence, as per the methodology requirements, we demark each land with unique identification number and have agreements signed with participating farmers to disclose their participation with other similar projects. If a farmer is found participating in another similar program, they will be removed from our project database and we no longer account emission removals from that land and report the same to respective monitoring reports. 
2.	There is a possibility that the participating farmer may sell his land to another farmer or any other person during the project cycle. It is the duty of the farmer to intimate Boomitra on the sale. The signed agreement will become null and void as soon as he sales the land. Then, Boomitra will approach the actual land owner, if he or she interested will have a new agreement. In case that person doesn t want to be part of the project, as said in above point that land will be removed from our project database and we no more account emission removals from that land and report the same to respective monitoring reports.
3.	Other major risk is that farmers going back to baselines practices due to traditional compulsions or some other reasons. Boomitra along with ground partners will have a regular awareness creation programs, capacity building programs in order to keep farmers informed about the consequences related to baseline scenario practices.
4.	Climate change also presents increased risks of severe weather, which are difficult to mitigate. Fires, pests and extreme weather conditions may result in reversals which are beyond the control of the project. 
Boomitra is employing the latest VM0042 methodology from VCS to estimate overall CDRs from the project. As per the methodology, a project-level buffer needs to created and the number of buffer credits to be contributed to the AFOLU pooled buffer account must be determined by applying the latest version of the VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool. This tool accounts for possibilities of direct and indirect (avoidable/unavoidable) reversal which may result in the reversal of CDRs. Hence, the project is capable of tackling the risks resulting from reversal with buffer credits available with VCS.
Boomitra, along with its trusted partners, will develop a robust monitoring plan to mitigate or avoid risks associated within the project. Community awareness programs and capacity building programs through training especially target the youth and women in the region.","As described earlier, project level buffer pools exist for use in the case or reversals, and these are calculated based on risk analysis of real risks of soil carbon in our projects, in addition to VERRA s standard VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence tool.

Cooperatieve Rabobank U.A.,No,Agroforestry Carbon Removal Units for the Organic Restoration of Nature by smallholder farmers,Acorn,Forestry (removal only),,,Agroforestry,"Acorn Agroforestry CRUs for the Organic Restoration of Nature is an agroforestry program that unlocks the international (voluntary) carbon market for smallholder farmers. Acorns mission is to combat climate change, land degradation and food insecurity with an inclusive agroforestry solution improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. This solution balances competing land use demands in a way that benefits both human well-being and the environment. This means land use that has a positive impact on food supply and livelihoods, the economy, environmental restoration, climate targets and development goals. 

To do this, Acorn has built a global, transparent and technology-enabled marketplace for carbon sequestration. This marketplace provides entry to the international carbon market for smallholder farmers who are realizing agroforestry projects for carbon sequestration through biomass growth, predominantly through trees, which is measured with the help of satellite monitoring. Acorn supports the initiation and development of these agroforestry projects and facilitates the subsequent trade of the so-called carbon removal units (CRUs) that are generated from the sequestered carbon. As such, the program:
- is accessible for smallholder farmers on a large scale
- ensures suitable agroforestry systems which capture sufficient carbon and provide decent farmer income 
- embraces innovative technologies 
- encourages the sale of ex-post carbon removal units 
Acorns carbon sequestration framework is specifically tailored to the needs and economics of the smallholder farmer, working from the bottom-up to support their role in our global food supply. The Framework supports farmers in improving soil and crop health, building resilience to climate change and weather events, increasing yields, and diversifying their income. The Framework also works to keep the costs of carbon sequestration and carbon market participation low with 80-90% of Carbon Removal Unit revenues for the smallholder farmer. ","The governance structure is built around several groups of stakeholders. The supply side of the proposition consists of local communities and individual smallholder farmers who are connected to one of Acorn s implementation partners in its intermediary network.  These partners could be NGOs, farmers  co-ops, trading companies or corporations. To join the network, they must outline a clear implementation and monitoring plan that ensures solid agroforestry systems at farm level. As Acorn s on-site representatives, they play an important role as Acorn s field advocates, responsible for active farmer engagement, farmer (platform) registration and data collection, and together with the farmers are key stakeholders in ensuring sustainable implementation. Solidaridad is an example of such an partner.
For monitoring and measurement, Acorn cooperates with a technical network of remote sensing partners (RSPs) that specialize in vegetation monitoring, machine learning, and biomass and carbon stock estimation. Together with these partners, Acorn is developing algorithms that measures biomass growth in a scalable and iterative manner. Examples include Satelligence and Space4Good.

Considering Acorn s inherent characteristics it will be difficult for Acorn to guarantee. Crops and trees are part of the Earth s natural carbon cycle, and therefore, by definition, carbon storage is not permanent . For carbon removal, Acorn thus refers to the concept of durability. Durability is defined as retaining for 20 years the level of sequestered CO2 that was sold as a CRU. 20 years is based on Roshetko, et al., (2002, Smallholder Agroforestry Systems as a Strategy for Carbon Storage) and Watson (2000, Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry)",All Acorn projects are monitored on their durability commitment at least every 5 years until the durability period is completed. If a negative biomass measurement occurs in the durability period annual monitoring will be applied until negative biomass is compensated.,"Acorn projects should review their reversal risks by making use of the reversal risk assessment  and high-risk areas should be mitigated with appropriate actions and should be monitored closely. At least every 5 years, projects should re-evaluate their reversal risks and report this to Acorn.","To guarantee durability, a Acorn buffer pool is created by setting aside a part of the CRUs issued. In case of unexpected premature release of carbon stock (e.g. through forest fires or illegal logging), CRUs are replaced from the buffer pool, referred to as buffer pool carbon removal units (BCRUs).",The Acorn buffer pool comprises the portfolio of Acorn projects only,Acorn projects supply 10% of generated CRUs to the buffer pool for the duration of the project to cover unforeseen premature loss of carbon stock,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Commitment to a minimum amount of Acorn CRUs per year, subject to terms & conditions to be mutually agreed upon",Option to specify projects preference / pre-approval (or specify selection criteria).

CQC has no distributed 269,000 seedlings in three successive wet seasons bring seedlings survivals to 50% through training and visitation.   Surviving seedlings two years reach 6 meters and first harvest of selected culms will start in April 2022.  CQC is now seeking a long term ERP to extend the program to about 6 million seedlings distributed with projected survival of 3 million comprising a virtual plantation of 9,500 ha , about 8% of the Government of Malawi's nationwide target under its 2017 Energy Strategy to meet wood fuel shortfall. Going forward under the project, successful growers and stove users will receive multiple seedlings each year, enabling them to meet their own fuel and construction wood needs and to sell surplus bamboo products locally and back to CQC as a sustainable source of fuel to replace charcoal in urban households. The species planted are non-invasive and high yielding, contributing significant biomass annually from year three and surviving without special protection after year two growing to 9 plus square meters of of clump size.

Malawi is heavily deforested and women spend up to two hours a day gathering fuel and wood over long distances and at considerable health risk away from their villages. CQC has spent heavily on independent research to determine these time savings and document the benefit of time savings to rural Africa women as the most productive agents of rural development and economic growth. CQC has demonstrated the powerful positive influence of providing high yield bamboo seedlings to families that see these plants as a pathway to prosperity compared to ever declining wood resources. After low survival rates in early years, CQC has been supported by USAUD to train women in bamboo horticulture and encourage plant protection.

C-Quest Capital LLC,No,Incentivizing and facilitating regeneration of degraded forests for Malawian Villages,Malawi Community Forest Regeneration,Forestry (removal only),,,Reforestation,"Malawi is losing forest cover at 0.7% pa. Loss is acute in densely populated agricultural landscapes due to population growth and lack of incentives and guidance to protect and re-establish forests cover. Drivers of forest loss are fuelwood gathering, charcoal production for last resort cash income, tobacco curing, and household construction wood. Most communities are now desperately short of wood and have to travel miles on foot to gather firewood. This project will provide incentives, nurseries/seedlings and technical assistance to delineate, restore and maintain natural forest to climax conditions where root stock remains with support from fast growing nitrogen fixing trees and plants to provide firewood and other wood needs. The project builds on successful pilots of incentive-driven village reforestation efforts over the past two decades that allow accurate projections of MAI under careful management. The focus is on hills and outcrops that are non agricultural land that have been denuded or severely degraded. These have been precisely mapped and agreed as regeneration areas with local communities who are excited to receive this support. Restored natural forests lead to sustainable pollarding of small branches fro firewood, restored availability if medicinal plants and other cultural uses of non-timber products, habitat for avifauna and small native animals. There are no cash payments. Incentives include water pumps for fresh water supply for each 30 households, beehives and beekeeping equipment, seedlings/nurseries for fast growing nitrogen fixing trees, high yield seeds for local crops and inputs and advise for conservation farming to double yields without artificial fertilizer on nearby farmland. The ration between reforested areas and conservation farming to increase soil organic matter, soil organic carbon and sustainable crop yield is 1: 0.5 forest to farmland. Carbon credits will be generated from both reforestation under a new A/R methodology under design fro approval by end 2021, and VM0017 for soil carbon sequestration on cropland. The A/R methodology will capture both reforestation removals and border and large trees inserted into farmland for soil conservation purposes. Forest plots range from 20ha to 100ha per village. The project is designed to build from the 2000ha presented here to 10,000 ha across Malawi over 5 years. CQC's efficient cookstoves will be supplied to all villages under existing projects redirected to target households to switch cooking fuels from tree wood to crop residues and shrubs.","The concept of village level natural forest regeneration was developed and pioneered by Total LandCare of Malawi (TLC). It has been successfully demonstrated in Malawi and Eastern Zambia by TLC. Zamia is an extension areas for a successful Malawi program. The Co-Founder of TLC, Trent Bunderson, now retired from TLC is the principal designer and technical advisor for this project. He is also the leading conservation/regenerative agriculture specialist in SE Africa and will design and supervise both reforestation and regeneration agriculture components fo the project.","The project was conceived by C-Quest Capital (CQC) and TLC that have been partners in sustainable development projects in Malawi since 2011. Given that donor funding has never been able to support more than a few hundreds of village level reforestation and until now carbon prices were too low to drive investment at scale, this concept of taking forest and conservation farming to scale has been stalled. At prices between $20-30/tCO2e, this form of long term restoration to stabilise livelihoods in the face of climate change is now economically feasible.

The risk is that the project cannot continue issuance until the carbon reversals have been made up. However, the dispersed nature of this project makes the risk of a loss threatening project continuity is minimal. ","As noted, reversal risk is mitigated by widely geographically dispersed plots of 20-100ha and by project structure which combines soil organic carbon, lower standing biomass density trees on small-holder farms, and standing fully forested plots under regeneration management. 
Risks of reversal are limited to fire risk in individual forest plots and clearing of plots by villages. The former is managed by large numbers fo small separated plots and the latter by the strength of the incentive system which leads to higher and more secure food yield and food security and improved incomes from sale of farm products and honey.",The VERRA buffer reserve pool covers Microsofts risk of reversal. The only risk Microsft faces is under-delivery through the need to make up reversals in one or more of the dozens of small regen forest plots. CQC is not committing to firm delivery given project uncertainty.,The buffer reserve pool is comprised of a risk-assessed set aside of a percentage the global portfolio of AFOLU projects. The buffer reserve for these specific projects is likely to be in the 15-20% range of VCUs verified year on year.,This percentage set aside from the proposed complex of projects will be assessed by the Validating and Verifying body but is likely to start at 20% and move down to 10% over multiple verifications if there are no reversal events and set aside margin proves conservative.,Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"The ideal outcome is  Microsoft commitment to purchase carbon credits at teh volumes and prices indicated corresponding to a 2000 ha project through 2030 at a minimum and preferably through 2040. Such a commitment would enable CQC to finance the project at this level from our own resources or in combination with other investment partners. Within two years from the start of the project we will have enough information to determine project economic feasibility with the expectation that broad market prices would be in the range of those Microsft has agreed to and we can expand the project on a commercial basis to 10,000 ha and plan replication in Zambia and other neighboring countries. ",Prices are flat. No indexing. No nuances.,"Following the methodologies proposed, baseline for single trees in and around farm land and as border planting for the regeneration planting requires no baseline assessment. Each tree is geolocated and is unique. For the village regen forest plots, the baseline of current stocks will be established per sample of intervention sites and reference areas agreed for similar non-intervention areas to ensure crediting only for increments over the potentially dynamic baseline on no intervention. For soil carbon, common practice for smallholder farms will be established for the farms to be transitioned to regenerative agriculture practices (residue retention, no-till, composting, agroforestry through interplanting, etc) and default factors of carbon sequestration claimed through verification of the sustained uptake of eligible practices. The entire landscape under intervention will also be recorded and monitored by medium resolution GIS that can measure biomass stocks above ground in the baseline and during intervention although satellite imagery will not be the basis for carbon crediting per se. Microsoft will be able to track regen forestry progress visually through satellite imagery nevertheless.",2000,35,5-10% increase per annum in early years,"The project will utilized CCBA and SDVista of which CQC is a pioneer to verify SDG outcomes at the community level arising from the project. CCBA Community Gold labels will be sought and SDVista Premium (to be announced by Verra soon) labels issued alongside VCUs from the project. Benefits include climate resilience from transitioning to sustainable agricultural land management with increased soil organic matter, water and nutrient retention and reduced need for artificial fertilizers to meet food needs. The health, well-bing and prosperity of women will be improved with water supply systems for each village, providing access to clean water in or near villages, and provision of income earning opportunities from honey production and trade. Higher yields of food from improved seed supply and sustained increases in soil fertility will also increase food and nutrition security and offer income from trade in surplus production. Re-establishment of native forest cover restores cultural and medicinal plant availability and provides improved habitat for native flora and fauna.","With parallel time savings from provision of improved cookstoves separately by CQC, women and girls will not only enjoy time savings of one to two hours a day from faster cooking and fuel switching to crop residue and small branch fuels, but they will have much improved seeds for high yielding crops available through the project and beehives and instruction for honey production to use time saved to improved incomes and prosperity. Monitoring and verification protocols fro these positive outcomes will be built into the CCBA/SDVista parallel documentation and third party verification processes. ","Women and girls will be especially benefitted from the project by being given income earning opportunities and training on the one hand and time saving water supply and cooking technology on the other.
This project is an example of ""growing back better"" after COVID that is key to recovery of the least developed countries, especially rural communities whose welfare has been decimated by COVID. CQC has funded a major multi-country study by Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy on time savings for women and girls from its 3 million household clean cooking investment and how to create opportunities to use this saved time productively to improve health and prosperity for women and girls.",There are no environmental os social harms that we can identify.,,,,,,
EcoAct Inc,Yes,"Reforestation and Restoration of degraded mangroves and sustainable livelihoods, Myanmar",Myanmar Mangroves Project,Coastal blue carbon (removal only),,,,"The proposed project falls under the Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) category of the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). The project will be implemented on 2146.48 ha of degraded lands of the Northern part of Ayeyarwady Division of Myanmar. The lands that will be restored under the project belong to Magyi, Thabawkan and Thaegone village tracts and this restoration will create a healthy mangrove ecosystem. 

The project s objective is to establish and maintain a sustainably managed mangrove ecosystem for carbon sequestration, natural disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction with sustainable livelihoods in the coastal communities. A vital component of the project is the conservation of biodiversity and establishment of the first mangrove gene bank in Myanmar. 

The project will also contribute to food security by reducing danger of erosion and salt intrusion in low lying agricultural land due to rising sea level. Restoration of mangrove forests will in addition substantially increase sea food resources to reverse the trend of crisis for small scale fishermen in the area. 

Without the project, carbon stocks in the project area will continue to decrease due to various anthropogenic activities. During 2015-2020 of mangrove restoration, the project will restore approximately 2146.48 ha of degraded lands by planting 9,116,390 new mangrove plants. The species identified for this reforestation project are Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Bruguiera cylindrica, Bruguiera sexangula and Ceriops tagal. This combination of mangrove restoration and coastal green belt protection will improve the biodiversity and also be a natural disaster risk reduction asset will also play a role as a carbon sink and also promote sustainable rural development in the area. 

The project is based on 3 years of research in cooperation with Pathein University and Myeik University to secure sustainability with maximum multi-purpose benefits in creating resilient communities for adaptation and mitigation to climate change.

The project will sequester an estimated 3.68 million tCO2e over a period of 20 years. 
The project area has been documented and certified as degraded and/or severely degraded mangroves below the threshold of the FAO forest definition. See section 1.12.1 for conditions prior to implementation in the PDD.

The received carbon credit funding will go to the creation and expansion of the new mangrove reforestation projects within Myanmar with one currently being registered as we speak.

After 2036, there may be a need for a second crediting period of 20 years. 

Durability guarantee is 30 - 50 years.","A risk assessment is completed as part of the monitoring process each year and depending on the risk score a percentage of credits will be reduced as buffer credits.
Once the risk assessment and monitoring report are complete the buyer will be alerted to any reversals experienced.
","VCS ensures the permanence and the environmental integrity of its carbon credits in the case of a  reversal � (i.e., after issuing credits for sequestering CO2, a project suffers a loss event, such as a fire, that releases the sequestered CO2 back into the atmosphere). The VCS requires all land-based projects to set aside a risk-adjusted percentage of the emission reductions and removals achieved, which are then placed into a global buffer pool. The buffer pool works much as insurance does, and  buffer credits �  “ managed by the VCS (not by the project owner)  “ can be canceled when reversals occur.",The project design document outlines that the project must be monitored every 5 years and any losses that have occurred since the previous monitoring period will then be reported. This project will undergo monitoring and verification on a yearly basis. VCS requires a non-permanence risk report using the VCS AFOLU Non-Permance Risk Tool at each monitoring event. The risk calculated then sets a percentage of offset credits that have to be deposited into a AFOLU buffer pool account which VCS is charge of.,The buffer pool is made up of AFOLU projects and are strictly removals.,10% of the credits generated by the project go into the buffer pool.,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Preferred to take the full volume of removals credits for FY22, however, we are open to smaller volumes and future volumes and long-term contracts. Minimum volume requirement of 4,000t and maximum offtake is listed in previous answers. Open to all lengths of tenure and the timeline for arranging multi-year offtakes should be within the 30 days as the credits for future volumes are in extremely high demand. ","Prices will increase for FY23 and onwards as outlined in previously in our response, however, we are open to negotiations if the full volume over 3-5 years is of interest.","The change in carbon stock in tree biomass in this project within the project boundary was estimated using the A/R methodological tool  estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities � (Version 04.2). Based on the tool the stock difference method was applied and the ex-ante tree biomass was estimated using the method of  Estimation by modelling of tree growth and stand development �. For the estimation of the changes in carbon stocks in tree biomass ex-post, field measurements in permanent sample plots at two points of time will be realized, and the calculations will be done following the  difference of two independent stock estimations � method. Under the  Estimation by modelling of tree growth and stand development � method, existing data (diameter etc) were used in combination with tree growth models to predict the growth of trees and the development of the tree stand over time. According to the methodology, ex-ante estimation of carbon stock in tree biomass is not subjected to uncertainty control, although the project participants should use the best available data and models that apply to the project site and the tree species.
Monitoring will be organized according to Section 06 of AR-AM0014. All the data that are mentioned in this section will be collected and archived electronically and kept for 2 years after the end of last crediting period. 
Project boundary - keeping records of the project boundary is one of the most important activities during monitoring. The geographic coordinates of the project boundary and all stratifications within the projecthave been established and will be recorded. Field surveys using GPS, satellite images and land usemaps have been used in this activity. This activity will be done throughout the project period to ensurethere are no errors in the definition of the project boundary. The project participant has a GIS expert who will be coordinating this section. There will be two staff members working with him in recording proper boundaries.
Existing plants - These existing plants are not accounted for the carbon stocks but will be left to grow and are monitored throughout the crediting period of the project activity. During the baseline studies the area has been visited by the survey team. Existing plants are recorded. Therefore there are records of existing plants in each sample plot. These plants will not be removed and will be monitored throughout the project period.
Supervision of project activities: The Project Manager has full responsibilities for all activities. There are 14 project staff members in the Magyi area as follows:
(1) Field Office Manager 1
(2) Technical Assistants 3
(3) Field Assistants 10
Project Manager has trained all staff about mangrove forest management, mangrove nursery techniques, natural resource management and community forestry activities. Technical Assistants and Field Assistant shall supervise all field operations. Similar structure is practiced in other areas (Thaegone and Thabawkan).
The Project Proponent will be responsible for implementation of this ARR project activity together with the local communities. PP has more than 130 professional staff at the Administrative Unit, Field Units and in Pathein University Park with backgrounds on forestry, marine science, economic and social Science, Remote sensing & GIS. The project will also employ over 300 workers for the reforestation and restoration activities.
The project implementation is based on the local presence of WIF staff in project area. The main role of the field officers is to manage the reforestation/restoration activity in close cooperation with WIF technical program coordinators. Following are some of their responsibilities:
 ¢	Randomly select and verify GPS locations of at least 10% of the plots planted during a particular planting season.
 ¢	Conduct comparisons between the trees actually planted and the trees recorded in the management plan
 ¢	Assess the survival rate of the mangrove seedlings and prepare reports with the findings.
 ¢	Area verification. Project parcels will be verified using GPS in the field as well as through drone images and Google Earth imagery analysis. 
Identification and monitoring of strata: Baseline stratification was done based on the landuse type. Most of the planting sites are severely degraded mangrove areas. Ex-ante stratification is done based on the year of replanting and year of restoration. Even though plot types are similar in the same landuse type, there is variation in soil composition, water salinity and water availability. Certain manmade activities such as replanting, protection also have influence on growth and survival. Therefore a stratification implemented today may not be realistic in the future once the local community starts managing these lands. Hence the final factors considered for the stratification will be the differences in the estimated carbon sinks for each mangrove species as the project evolves. Due to this reason, strata will be monitored periodically. If a change in number and area of the project strata occurs, the sampling framework will be adjusted accordingly.
This proposed ARR VCS project is designed as to the planting and restoration will happen from 2015-2020. Therefore the database will be updated periodically capturing the following:
 ¢	Unpredicted disturbance occurring during the crediting period 
 ¢	Unpredicted disturbances occurring during the crediting period (changes in hydrology, sedimentation, disease, and/or human factors), affecting differently different parts of an originally homogeneous stratum or stand;
 ¢	Mangrove forest establishment (planting, re-replanting) may be implemented at different intensities, dates and spatial locations than mentioned in the PD; Sampling plan and stratification: As mentioned above, the ex-ante stratification of the project was done by year of planting. Such stratification was selected to increase the measuring precision without increasing unnecessary costs.

For ex ante stratification the strata are as follows:
Strata 1: 2015 planting
Strata 2: 2016 planting
Strata 3: 2017 planting
Strata 4: 2018 planting
Strata 5: 2019 planting
Strata 6: 2020 planting
Strata 7: 2015 restoration
Strata 8: 2016 restoration
Strata 9: 2017 restoration
Strata 10: 2018 restoration

Mangrove forests are coastal plant communities that are part of a larger coastal ecosystem that typically includes mud flats, seagrass meadows, tidal marshes, salt barrens and even coastal upland forests and freshwater wetlands (i.e. peatlands), freshwater streams and rivers (Lewis, 2001). Establishing mangrove forests on degraded, underutilized lands will sequestrate significant amount of GHGs compared to baseline.
Under the project, soil conditions are checked, nutrition is retained on the land and therefore water quality will be increased compared with the baseline scenario. The soil organic contents and mineral contents will be improved due to proper land management. Vegetation cover is expected to improve soil conditions. Mangrove restoration will further increase fish resources with up to 50%, protecting lives and properties from extreme weather, provide cooling effect from mangrove trees and provide other vital ecosystem services and establishment of the first mangrove gene bank with 64 species to be followed with long-term research. Protecting endangered flora and fauna with emphasis on sea grass meadows/ coral reefs/ blue carbon and protection of endangered dugongs and elephants, and other species of flora and fauna that were previously not visible.
Social Equity and Justice
The project involves low-income families in the area who will get more opportunities to increase their income and thus be less prone to pursue unsustainable practices that might increase CO2 emissions, harm the environment, and further reduce the mangroves. The project creates direct employment at agreed wages of the local communities involved in the project and the project promoter is committed to provide all the training necessary. The project proponent (PP) will promote a working family model where both men and women can actively participate in the project. Emphasis to be made on female empowerment projects, as well as expansion of scholarships for university studies to girls from poor families. Improvements to the infrastructure in the area are being carried out by the PP to provide economic accessibility to the project area but also to improve farmers  access and strengthen the competitiveness of the farmers when it comes to taking their food crops to the market.

Economic Benefits / Social Equity and Justice 
The labour requirement for the project will be fulfilled with local employment. Therefore, the major portion of the budget on labour will be retained within the country and the local community. The project pays its workers above normal wages with additional support in solving problems such as supporting construction of community flood walls, securing fresh water supplies in the dry season, repairing broken floors and roofs of school buildings, distributing solar lamps to families with school children, distribution of school bags and raincoats etc. In addition to improving livelihoods: 30% of the total project budget is for public education, social mobilisation, livelihood creation, micro loans, cottage industries, aquaculture, scholarships, and subsidies for fuel saving stoves, female empowerment projects and scholarships. More permanent job opportunities are in progress: a demonstration unit on oyster culture was established in 2016, colouring textiles with natural mangrove colours was established with 12 female participants in 2016, nypa sap production initiated in 2015, virgin coconut oil production, sea weed production and mini hydroponic projects to start in 2017. This will be followed up with new projects after consultation with community leaders and local entrepreneurs. The project has from the start been supporting schools in the area with educational assistance, and in particular on mangrove restoration, as well as establishing school nurseries, art competitions etc. This has hugely helped the community realize and understand the value of mangrove restoration.
Also project benefits:
 ¢	Number of crab fishermen increased from 2 to 24 in 2018 due to additional crab resources after mangrove restoration;
 ¢	Mangroves increase seafood resources by over 50%;
 ¢	70% of the trained planters are women;
 ¢	50 women assisted to establish their own clam culture ponds;
 ¢	50 youths were trained in computer operation and English language;
 ¢	80 fishermen benefit from increased sea food resources due to mangrove restoration, + 24 new livelihoods in crab production;
 ¢	4 schools were awarded solar panels and computers for training;
 ¢	2 support prosthetic legs for two students.

","Ongoing site audits, monitoring reports and third-party verification is conducted each year, keeping in line with VCS requirements.","The situation for the people in the project areas is critical. Their living standard for the majority is below poverty line. The aim is to increase family income by 100% during the next 5 years. This will be done in close consultation with the people in the areas. According to the socio-economic survey conducted by WIF and University of Pathein, there are 827 households in Shwe thaun gyan city (Magyi Township) and the total population is approximately 3000. There were 1034 households and the population in Thaegone is around 4550. Thabawkan had 633 houses and the population was 3283. These communities have been depending on mangroves for their food production and fuel-wood consumption. Therefore during the stakeholder meetings it was discussed and agreed to introduce alternative livelihoods and solutions for their fuel need.
See Question 40. For the relevant co-benefits
","No potential Environmental or Social Harm foreseen. 
There is no displacement occurring due to the project activity. Therefore, surrounding communities and the Forest Department officers have no objection in this project. In fact, they have positive attitudes towards the ARR VCS project activity due to following reasons:
(1) Increased income
This project was designed specially targeting the local community. The objective of the Project is sustainable development and natural resource management of the project area. Therefore, the project has embraced any villager who would like to work on the basis of this model. Low income families in the area will get more opportunities to increase their income. This will be a support for their livelihood.
(2) New employment opportunities
Skilled and unskilled labour is needed for this project. The project creates direct employment opportunities in the establishment, maintenance and monitoring the mangroves in the project/villages area. Previously many of youth in these villages have gone to neighbouring districts for income generating employment. As a result, in many cases only the children and older generation remained on their land. Reportedly due to this many youth stopped going to school at a young age. This situation has good potential to change due to newly created employment provided by the project. Youth would have the opportunity to both work and study to reach their potential. The project promotes a working family model where both men and women are actively participating in the project. There are sufficient opportunities where women can work in the project.
(3) Knowledge on silvicultural techniques
As identified in the barrier analysis planting mangroves needs proper silvicultural knowledge if the plants are to succeed in the long run. The project proponent and its staff have very good experience and knowledge of mangroves and this is being transferred it to the local communities.
(4) Infrastructure development & Change in lifestyle
During mid-2019  “ mid-2020 monitoring period a 10-month training program for 24 candidates was organized on social entrepreneurship. Upon successful training, they were requested to propose new enterprises in the area. Ideas like bee honey production, clam production, a small yard for boat building, production of energy saving stoves, seaweed production, virgin coconut production, ice plant for fishing industry, aquaculture projects with emphasis on crab farming will be followed up for implementation. As part of the follow up process, a crab hatchery is under construction and technicians have been sent to Vietnam for training. Construction of the hatchery has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Another 3 sites for ice plants have been identified and technical details completed in cooperation with an ice plant specialist. A plan for seaweed production completed. The consultant for the project is presently stuck in Abu Dhabi due to lack of flight to Myanmar. He has been on a short time engagement for FAO and was ready to start work in May. The project will start as soon as he is back in the country. A small boat yard started in December and has produced its first fiberglass boat. 2 energy forests have been established and solar panels mounted on school roofs in 2 communities, followed by computer labs with training. 300 solar lamps were distributed to school children and a printer was donated to the school.

Under the  Estimation by modelling of tree growth and stand development � method, existing data (diameter etc) were used in combination with tree growth models to predict the growth of trees and the development of the tree stand over time. According to the methodology, ex-ante estimation of carbon stock in tree biomass is not subjected to uncertainty control, although the project participants should use the best available data and models that apply to the project site and the tree species. Monitoring will be organized according to Section 06 of AR-AM0014. All the data that are mentioned in this section will be collected and archived electronically and kept for 2 years after the end of last crediting period. Project boundary - keeping records of the project boundary is one of the most important activities during monitoring. The geographic coordinates of the project boundary and all stratifications within the project have been established and will be recorded. Field surveys using GPS, satellite images and land use maps  have been used in this activity. This activity will be done throughout the project period to ensure there are no errors in the definition of the project boundary. The project participant has a GIS expert who will be coordinating this section. There will be two staff members working with him in recording proper boundaries. Existing plants - These existing plants are not accounted for the carbon stocks but will be left to grow and are monitored throughout the crediting period of the project activity. During the baseline studies the area has been visited by the survey team. Existing plants are recorded. Therefore there are records of existing plants in each sample plot. These plants will not be removed and will be monitored throughout the project period. Supervision of project activities: The Project Manager has full responsibilities for all activities. There are 14 project staff members in the Magyi area as follows: (1) Field Office Manager 1 (2) Technical Assistants 3 (3) Field Assistants 10
Project Manager has trained all staff about mangrove forest management, mangrove nursery techniques, natural resource management and community forestry activities. Technical Assistants and Field Assistant shall supervise all field operations. Similar structure is practiced in other areas (Thaegone and Thabawkan). The Project Proponent will be responsible for implementation of this ARR project activity together with the local communities. PP has more than 130 professional staff at the Administrative Unit, Field Units and in Pathein University Park with backgrounds on forestry, marine science, economic and social Science, Remote sensing & GIS. The project will also employ over 300 workers for the reforestation and restoration activities. The project implementation is based on the local presence of WIF staff in project area. The main role of the field officers is to manage the reforestation/restoration activity in close cooperation with WIF technical program coordinators. Following are some of their responsibilities:  ¢ Randomly select and verify GPS
locations of at least 10% of the plots planted during a particular planting season.  ¢ Conduct 
comparisons between the trees actually planted and the trees recorded in the management plan  ¢ Assess the survival rate of the mangrove seedlings and prepare reports with the findings.  ¢ Area verification. Project parcels will be verified using GPS in the field as well as through drone images and Google Earth imagery analysis. Identification and monitoring of strata: Baseline stratification was done based on the land use type. Most of the planting sites are severely degraded mangrove areas. Ex-ante stratification is done based on the year of replanting and year of restoration. Even though plot types are similar in the same land use type, there is variation in soil composition, water salinity and water availability. Certain manmade activities such as replanting, protection also have influence on growth and survival. Therefore a stratification implemented today may not be realistic in the future once the local community starts managing these lands. Hence the final factors considered for the stratification will be the differences in the estimated carbon sinks for each mangrove species as the project evolves. Due to this reason, strata will be monitored periodically. If a change in number and area of the project strata occurs, the sampling framework will be adjusted
accordingly.",4500,104.65,303.47,"Ecosystem Protection/ Climate Resilience
Mangrove forests are coastal plant communities that are part of a larger coastal ecosystem that typically includes mud flats, seagrass meadows, tidal marshes, salt barrens and even coastal upland forests and freshwater wetlands (i.e. peatlands), freshwater streams and rivers (Lewis, 2001). Establishing mangrove forests on degraded, underutilized lands will sequestrate significant amount of GHGs compared to baseline. Project is implemented by Worldview International Foundation in cooperation with other partners who are committed to environmental sustainability and social responsibility and are confident that the extraordinary costs involved in pioneering this project will eventually be covered by the supplementary cash flow from sale of VCUs. Under the project, soil conditions are checked, nutrition is retained on the land and therefore water quality will be increased compared with the baseline scenario. The soil organic contents and mineral contents will be improved due to proper land management. Vegetation cover is expected to improve soil conditions. Mangrove restoration will further increase fish resources with up to 50%, protecting lives and properties from extreme weather, provide cooling effect from mangrove trees and provide other vital ecosystem services.

EcoAct Inc,No,Niger Acacia Senegal ARR Plantation Project,Niger Acacia Senegal ARR Plantation Project,Forestry (removal only),,,Reforestation,"This first Nigerien ARR project activity (Niger Acacia Senegal Plantation Project, NASPP hereafter), aims to restore deforested and highly degraded land in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of the Republic of Niger by empowering rural communities to adopt sustainable agro-forestry practices by establishing plantations using native species Acacia senegalensis (Acacia Senegal). This project represents the first effort in Niger to establish Acacia Senegal plantations on a large scale in regions where dry forests are unable to regenerate by natural means. The sale of emission reduction credits from the carbon sequestered in plantations will make the project more viable by providing an additional revenue stream that will supplement income from the sale of gum arabic from the acacia trees. 

The project landscape is composed of severely degraded and still degrading discrete areas, with a vegetation composed mainly by grass savannah in which we can found grazing activities, under the transhumance system, and subsistence agriculture, these activities are conducted in a non tech way, using human or animal force for its execution. The project activity started in 2006 and a total of about 8,472 ha of Acacia plantations will be developed under the project, which is expected to produce around 4,600 tons of Arabic gum each year at full capacity and sequester about 135,770 tCO2e by 2012 and over 313,008 tCO2e by 2017 i.e. an annual average GHG emission reduction of 24,957 tCO2e.

The project started in 2006 through the Community Action Program (CAP) which was formed by experts from the World Bank's Carbon Unit. The way that the World Bank operates is that they typically have a 15-year time horizon, so the project is now looking for a long-term investor. The carbon funds are used to directly finance development projects that had been identified at the general assembly. ","The main participants are: 
Achats Service International (ASI): 
- Achat Service International (ASI) is a limited liability company established in 1986 to assist communities involved in gum arabic production and carbon sequestration. To this end, ASI has established a Project Management and Monitoring Unit (PMMU) in charge of coordinating all activities related to planting, including (i) monitoring of planting campaigns by communities, (ii) technical assistance in the field with the participation of other structures such as ME/E/LCD, (iii) monitoring of carbon stocks, (iv) capacity building, and (v) the communication plan and external representation of the project.
- Community Action Program (CAP) of the Ministry of Agriculture for the Financing of the Unit of Project Management and Monitoring (UGSP activities) and the Guarantee of transfer of funds to communities. The UGSP has conducted field missions to ensure that communities understand their rights and obligations and clearly establish how the funds received will be managed and distributed within the community (allocation of income).
- Ministry in charge of Water and Forests  “ support by providing field supervisors and help in monitoring activities. 
- National Council for the Environment for Sustainable Development (CNEDD) - supports the issuance of the project approval letter and participation in capacity building and training activities.
- Rural communities have set up management committees (COGES) to support the sites that work in partnership with the communities and the project. They carry out project activities in accordance with the operational plan (establishment and maintenance of plant materials, protection of sites, respect of site boundaries, etc.), ensure the availability of carbon stocks within the project perimeter until the end of the accounting period, use the carbon funds in accordance with the development objectives of the community.
The Project Management and Monitoring Unit (PMU) is composed of three executives: the coordinator, the monitoring and evaluation officer and the technical assistant. Monitoring activities are carried out in a collegial manner by the three members of the PMU. However, other institutions support the PMU in the implementation of the project, particularly in the technical monitoring of sites. The PMU conducts joint missions to evaluate the seedling production and plantations at the end of each year. The National Environment Council for Sustainable Development (CNEDD) also conducts monitoring missions to evaluate the conditions of the project sites. At the regional level, the CAP and the Regional Directorate of the Environment carry out periodic monitoring. At the departmental level, the departmental directorate in charge of the environment regularly monitors the implementation of activities, to which the biocarbon agent also reports on achievements. At the communal level, the mayor in turn makes periodic visits to check on the progress of the sites and resolve any problems. Finally, the COGEs, which carries out the activities, also monitors the activities carried out by the village groups, ensuring the quality of the work according to the training received.
The project has developed a fruitful partnership with a group of teacher-researchers from the University of Maradi for all biomass assessments and carbon calculation activities in accordance with the procedures agreed upon in the DDP. The data were stored at the UGSP.
","The project started in 2006 with the following actors and roles:
- Achat Service International (ASI) is a limited liability company established in 1986 to assist communities involved in gum arabic production and carbon sequestration, ASI signed an agreement with the World Bank's Biocarbon Fund on December 18, 2006 to aggregate the sale of gum and emission reductions during the program's implementation. The World Bank s Biocarbon Fund has a 15-year investment horizon so now the project is looking for a new partner.
ASI has established a Project Management and Monitoring Unit (PMMU) in charge of coordinating all activities related to planting, including (i) monitoring of planting and promotion of planting campaigns, (ii) technical assistance in the field with the participation of other government bodies such as the Ministry of the Environment, (iii) monitoring of carbon stocks, (iv) capacity building, and (v) the communication plan and external representation of the project.
Community Action Program (CAP) of the Ministry of Agriculture:
- Financing of UGSP activities
- Technical support to the project at the regional coordination level
- Monitoring the application of the financing agreements for the implementation of planting and monitoring activities
- Guarantee the transfer of funds to the communities.
Ministry in charge of Water and Forests:
- Implementing planting activities by ensuring the timely start of annual planting campaigns and adequate care and protection of crops for good tree growth
- Provision of close supervision agents in the field.
- Assistance to the UGSP to collect monitoring data on the plantations
- Capacity building of the communities and support on the follow-up activities. 
National Environment Council for Sustainable Development (CNEDD):
- Issuance of the letter of approval for the project
- Participation in capacity building and training activities.
Rural communities :
Management committees for the biocarbon sites have been set up and work in partnership with the communes and the project.
The intervention of the communities is done through the following points:
- Execution of project activities in accordance with the operational plan (establishment and maintenance of plant materials, protection of sites, respect of site boundaries, etc.).
- Ensuring the availability of carbon stocks within the project boundary until the end of the accounting period 
- Transfer of VERs to ASI according to the terms of their contract

According to the NASPP PDD monitoring plan systematic stratified sampling based on density and plantation age should be applied. However, the scattered, small size and variability of the actual density of the plantations following replanting activities support the choice of a random stratified sampling based on age only. 7 levels (strata) of sampling based on the age of the plantation blocks (from 2006 to 2013) were identified; and a total of 131 plots were thus retained on the 26 sites of the Biocarbon project.
The total number of survey plots was determined with a 10% margin of error (90% confidence level) by the WinrockSample Plot calculator (ARAM-Tool-03-v2.1.0) based on the area of the strata and the approximate value of the variance of biomass stocks in each stratum estimated from a preliminary sample of existing data related to the project area (Inventory Report 2015). Each stratum consists of plantation blocks of different sizes. Based on the number of plots to be surveyed per, an average area per stratum (Total stratum area/Total number of plots to be completed in the stratum), or sampling unit, is calculated to identify planting blocks to be surveyed (block area greater than sampling unit) and determine the number of plots to be surveyed in the block.
The random sampling tool in QGIS 2.18 was used to determine the exact location (geographic coordinates) of the permanent plots in the selected blocks. These coordinates are then fed into a Garmin eTrexÂ®30x GPS receiver for their location in the field. For the three (3) sites that were inaccessible due to insecurity, the plots planned for sampling (12 plots, including 2 in Gr madi and 5 for each of the Tam and Tchikatkadoua sites) were moved to secure sites of the same nature (planting age and soil type). However, the biomass and carbon sequestered in the three sites were estimated from data collected on sites of the same stratum with similar conditions, i.e., with almost the same ecological characteristics.

EcoAct Inc.,No,Reforestation of Colombia's degraded Savannah,Vichada Climate Reforestation Project,Forestry (removal only),,,Reforestation,"The project combines both reforestation and afforestation activities with biodiversity protection and ecosystem regeneration, ultimately transforming degraded savannah lands into close-to-nature forests that both produce high quality hardwoods and sequester large amounts of carbon. These forests offer a natural habitat for native wildlife, enrich the soil, save and filter water and help mitigate the greenhouse effect by acting as a carbon sink.
The Vichada Climate Reforestation project generates a range of significant environmental and socio-economic benefits. By mixing afforestation and reforestation activities, the project conserves remaining forests and promotes ecosystem interconnectivity by establishing ecological corridors. This improves biodiversity, and studies on the local flora have been developed through collaboration between regional NGOs. The project further protects natural resources, with trees shielding the soil from erosion to prevent flooding and optimise water quality. Where possible, minimal amounts of only the least harmful pesticides are used, softening the environmental impact of chemicals. Income from secure job opportunities with legal protections for workers helps alleviate local poverty, with leadership and development programs also offered to employees. The project is run by a multicultural team of men and women, and educates the community on climate change and the importance of sustainability activities. Community educational opportunities are further improved by capacity building programs in local schools.
No communitarian areas are nvolved in the project.  All the  project  area  is  legally  registered  under  the national authorities and poses a legal land tenure title.

","The project is located in the Vichada Department and the Orinoco river basin, combining reforestation for sustainable timber production with biodiversity protection and ecosystem restoration. In addition to the reforestation of the savannah, the project protects the remaining patches of native vegetation and creates additional conservation areas on the banks of rivers and other watersheds. The forests offer a natural habitat for native animals and plants, protect and enrich the soil, save and filter water and contribute to the mitigation of the greenhouse effect. For the project developers, regional employment is a special priority, including capacity building and technology transfers.
Current situation: Before the project activity started, the baseline of the project area was a savannah.  All this areas wer evaluated and classified  as applicable  planting  areas  for  A/R activities.  Other  small  patches  of native vegetation left were classified and nowadays managed as conservation  areas. Other areas (previously planted or due to the project activity) located in the border of a river or other watershed are also classified as conservation areas. Further cattle ranging was an activity identified during the additionality assessment. By  mid-80s  Colombia  completed  the  process  of  territorial  occupation  of  the  Caribbean  and Andean  regions, and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  Orinoco.  However  regions  in  the  Orinoco  classified  as  savannah  (19%  from  the country  area)  were  occupied  to  implement  cattle  farming  systems1.

Family Forest Impact Foundation,Yes,Bringing family-owned forests off the sidelines and into the climate fight.,Family Forest Carbon Program (FFCP),Forestry (removal only),,,Improved Forest Management,"The Family Forest Carbon Program is a collaboration between The Nature Conservancy and the American Forest Foundation to engage America s family-owned forests in the fight against climate change.  Because families and individuals own the largest share of our nation s forests, the engagement of these landowners is necessary to activate our largest potential Natural Climate Solution, which is enhanced storage and sequestration of carbon in forests. Historically, these landowners have been unable to participate in carbon markets because of the high transaction costs of traditional forest carbon projects. TNC and AFF have collaborated on the design of a new methodology under Verra s Voluntary Carbon Standard that is practice-based, meaning that landowners are compensated for the implementation of a specific management practice.  Currently the program offers landowners in the Central Appalachians two options:  1) Growing Mature Forests, under which we provide funding to limit (but not eliminate) timber harvests and let trees grow large for 20 years; and 2) Enhancing Future Forests, which provides funding to remove invasive or other competing plants that prevent trees from growing.  Additional practices are under development for both the Central Appalachians and other forested regions of the country.  The program aims to recruit approximately 7,000 landowners and 500,000 acres within the Central Appalachians over the next 5-7 years, while also launching similar efforts in other regions.  Because family landowners own such a large portion of America s forests, the mitigation opportunity is immense if we can reach an appropriate scale:  approximately 2 gigatons between now and 2100, assuming we can enroll roughly 20% of the eligible land base by 2030.    

The program delivers CDR by incentivizing landowners to manage their forests in a way that accelerates carbon sequestration.  In Growing Mature Forests, larger, faster growing trees are maintained on the landscape, which leads to additional sequestration.  In Enhancing Future Forests, the removal of competition leads to increased growth and sequestration.  The majority of payments from Microsoft for CDR would go to the landowner, while the minority would go to cover program costs such as landowner engagement, technical assistance for landowners, monitoring, program administration, and program finance costs.    

Within the partnership, TNC leads the science and methodological work, along with the engagement of corporate partners and external stakeholders.  AFF leads the design and implementation of landowner engagement efforts.  Both organizations collaborate closely on all aspects of the program.","The Family Forest Carbon Program is a partnership between The Nature Conservancy, The American Forest Foundation, and the Family Forest Impact Foundation.    

The American Forest Foundation (AFF) is a conservation impact non-profit dedicated to the sustainability of America s family-owned forests.  AFF works with more than 80,000 landowners across the country, promoting sustainable forest management that promotes a broad array of forest values, including but not limited to carbon storage and sequestration, clean air, clean water, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and strong rural economies.  Within the FFCP, they are responsible for the design and implementation of our landowner engagement efforts.  They also collaborate with TNC on stakeholder, customer and investor engagement.  

The Family Forest Impact Foundation (FFIF) is a subsidiary organization of AFF.   Its role is to hold the contracts with landowners, with investors, and with the buyers of the credits produced by the program.  In many cases, FFIF will have a contract with TNC for the credits produced by the program, and TNC will have a contract with the ultimate credit buyer.

Within the partnership, TNC leads the science and methodological work.  AFF leads the design and implementation of landowner engagement efforts.  Both organizations collaborate closely on all aspects of the program, along with the engagement of corporate partners and external stakeholders. ","AFF partnered with TNC starting in 2018 during which we identified carbon sequestration on private family-owned forestland as the greatest natural climate solution to climate change in the US. The program was initially philanthropically financed. Now, we are financed with traditional debt financing. From 2018 to 2019 AFF and TNC jointly developed our new carbon accounting methodology employing use of an observed and measured baseline versus that of a projected baseline typically found in legacy carbon projects. Our methodology is currently with Verra, seeking final verification status by EOY2021. In 2019 we launched our pilot program in Pennsylvania, and in 2020 we expanded the program into the Central Appalachians, the Northeast, and Midwest United States. We are planning to expand into Southeast United States early 2022. TNC provides auxiliary project support on the scientific and technical aspects of the FFCP while AFF implements the program operations and logistics on the ground.

This subtle change in our approach to monitoring allows us to monitor stock change on a statistically significant sample of participating properties, rather than on every property ”while still confirming that every enrolled property is implementing appropriately. Stock changes are measured on  treated � project plots and compared to an observed baseline.  The baseline is monitored through matched control plots “achieved by weighting a composite of similar FIA plots. The delta between the project and baseline plots equals the carbon benefit that can then be verified and eventually monetized.  The accounting does not rely on long-term growth and yield modeling of anticipated baseline performance; instead, baselines are updated with every MRV cycle with updated FIA data to capture changes in large scale forest ecosystem, policy and market dynamics.  This approach addresses one of the major concerns of the marketplace in regard to IFM projects, which is the accuracy of the baseline and the system-gaming that can occur when that baseline is set.

In specific we've identified the following as the most important risks: rate of landowner recruitment and forester capacity, the scaling of qualifying demand and uncertainty over rules changes within the VCM, and lack of access to credit enhancement.",100,100,"Our expected durability term of 100 years is consistent with Verra's VCS permanence risk assessment. We account for the risk of reversal by utilizing three tools, the first of which being inherent intelligent program design. Second, we contribute to Verra's Buffer Pool and can compensate the difference in credits here for unintentional/unavoidable reversal. Lastly, for intentional/avoidable reversals, we have an established internal Permanence Fund should financial compensation for intentional/avoidable reversals be necessary. ","First and most importantly, our practices are designed to be self-sustaining after the initial contractual period. We are financing a forest landowner s transition to more sustainable forest management practices. Just as a farmer transitioning to organic practices incurs lost revenue during the transition, but ultimately emerges from the transition with a more profitable management regime, so too landowners who adopt our practices will experience an initial opportunity cost (addressed through an incentive payment to the landowner), followed by a positive return on investment after the contract period. Sustainable forestry practices produce more timber, and thus more timber value, in the long-run, than business-as-usual practices. Because of this, reversals after the contract period would not be in the financial interest of the landowner, and we can therefore expect them to be infrequent. 

Because we will produce credits certified under the Voluntary Carbon Standard, our credits will be monitored and reversals reported over a 100-year timeframe, consistent with VCS protocol. VCS  approach to permanence involves a risk-assessment, where credits are purposefully reserved to address reversals and other permanence issues. Our program will incorporate this risk-assessment approach and will go further to address durability.","We can foresee potential market events (such as a spike in the prices for high-quality hardwoods) that might induce some reversals among  alumni � of the FFCP. To address this risk, we will pursue a mixture of the following strategies: We will seek to re-enroll landowners in subsequent FFCP contracts whenever possible. We will use remote sensing to monitor reversals on properties that were enrolled in FFCP to quantify the amount of reversals and their carbon impact. We will recruit additional landowners to replace the lost carbon benefits the program has procured. Our financial model includes setting aside a portion of the profit margin from the program in a  Permanence Fund � to finance such replacements. Eventually, we may replace carbon lost from reversals with carbon removals from other projects or even other sectors. We will pursue conversations with insurers and re-insurers about innovative new insurance products, such as parametric assurance, that would align insurance payments with key events correlated with reversals (such as a spike in timber). 

These strategies, combined with the pre-existing assurances offered by the VCS buffer pool, allow buyers to be confident in the 100-year durability of the credits offered by the program.  ","As mentioned in the prior section, potential market events such as a spike in the prices for high-quality timber may change a landowner's intentions with FFCP, pushing them to harvest earlier than expected. This would be an example of an intentional/avoidable reversal. For intentional/avoidable reversals, FFCP has established a Permanence Fund for financial compensation. An example of unintentional/unavoidable reversal would be uncontrollable wildfires burning through inventory on properties enrolled in the FFCP. ","Verra's buffer pool is specific to projects including agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) projects. Verra currently does not differentiate between unavoided emissions and removals in their buffer, but we expect this to change.","The amount we contribute to the buffer pool will ultimately be determined by the verification/validation body who audits us when we do our annual verification in the spring. Based on our calculations of our non-permanence risk, we plan on contributing 10% of our carbon benefit to Verra's buffer pool. Should our auditor believe our non-permanence risk is higher than 10%, we will contribute more.",Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"Our ideal outcome is a long-term offtake agreement which would secure the funding to enable the FFCP to further expand in operations and scale across the country. We are seeking a 5-25 year s length contract with the minimum contract volume of 50100,000 metric tons. Our maximum annual tonnage is based on credit production from the program, hence why securing long-term agreements is beneficial for both parties. We are currently executing long-term offtake agreements and can execute in a relatively short period of time.","We have an established floor price which represents the bare minimum requirement to operate the FFCP, 50% of which going directly back to family landowners in the form of direct financial assistance, 27% of which going into technical support for landowners and their improved forest management plans, and the remaining amount dedicated to the cost of operations. We add a 15% markup to the floor price to determine our market pricing. We apply discounts to the floor price depending on the length and volume requested in our contract. Our pricing escalates 3% per year based on our financial modeling.","The FFCP deploys a range of methods to measure carbon removal. First, we use datasets sourced from the USDA, Verra VCS Standard, and IPCC guidelines combined with plot-based sampling in our project areas to establish our measured baselines. Using remote GIS imagery from USDA FIA databases, we are able to determine and match control plots that represent baseline scenarios. Each control plot is paired to each sample plot, which we then monitor over time to establish a dynamic performance benchmark for additionality and crediting baselines.

For projects in the SE, 1.5 metric tons per acre.",Our per acre rate should stay around the same year over year,"The FFCP will produce several co-benefits.  We have completed a preliminary exercise mapping those co-benefits against the UN SDGs, namely water stewardship, ecosystem protection, social equity & justice, and climate resilience.  Currently, none of our co-benefits are certified by a third-party standard (ex: SD Vista).  However, we have applied for funding to pursue SD Vista verified biodiversity certification.

SDG 12: Model the amount of additional board feet available for local timber production because of the program.
SDG 1: The program will support rural economies through direct incentive payments and long-term development of sustainable timber markets. 
SDG 17: FFCP represents a unique partnership between landowners, corporations, investors, federal and state agencies, local and national conservation groups, and actors within the forest products industry. ","To date, even though family forest owners with less than 1,000 acres represent over 80% of family-owned land in the U.S., they only account for less than 1% of the current carbon projects. The reason is the high transaction costs associated with project development under existing IFM methodologies. We designed a new methodology, fully consistent with existing forest carbon standards, that specifically addresses the challenges family owners face in accessing carbon markets. With our new methodology, the FFCP advances DEI by granting American families and rural landowners access and inclusion in the Voluntary Carbon Market, providing them additional revenue which in turn contributes to more resilient communities and local economies. ","The Family Forest Carbon Program provides incentive payments to landowners to adopt more sustainable forest management practices, in line with the best available science on silviculture. Our practices will produce not only carbon, but additional benefits, including the improvement of habitat for at-risk species, and the support for rural economies. The only potential negative impact we have identified is a short-term reduction in the amount of timber available to the local hardwood sawmill industry. But this impact will be short-lived, as the adoption of FFCP practices at scale will increase over time the total timber volumes available to wood processing industries, for the same reason that it will increase carbon on the landscape: because better forest management leads to more productivity and volume.  To avoid any potential negative impacts, our practices sharply limit and proscribe the type and method of timber harvesting that can be practiced.",,,,,,

GECA Environnement is the project developer responsible for representing Oregon Biochar. Puro.earth is the standard that has developed the methodology used for this carbon project and the platform used to reliably quantify the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere. Oregon Biochar removal project was officially certified in June of 2021. Oregon Biochar s biochar has high stability and the ability to permanently remove 2.08 mtons of CO2e per mtons of biochar. 

The goal of this project is to use this biochar in farming and environmental practices to derive climate, food, soil and water benefits from its application. In this project, the biochar will be added to manure lagoons and to soil, directly as an amendment or indirectly by irrigating with biochar-containing lagoon water. In lagoons,  biochar reduces fossil fuel consumption from tractor usage, reduce odor (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7904243/) and enhance lagoon water quality. Farmers who have trialed this particular biochar in their lagoons and crops have seen 10% freshwater savings in irrigation, 10% yield increases and 20% fertilizer decrease. Literature has also found similar results for irrigation water savings (https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/18/7678/htm, https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/54/11/article-p1872.xml), crop yield and fertilizer usage (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sum.12546, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969721009360). Additionally, biochar may be used in industrial water filtration to replace fossil activated carbon and intercept nutrients (https://se.copernicus.org/preprints/6/1101/2014/sed-6-1101-2014.pdf). 

In the absence of Microsoft's funding, it would not be financially viable for commodity and conventional farmers to use biochar given its production cost. The farmers we target currently and foreseeably do not have the margins to pay for biochar at its normal price. Moreover, most farmers require powdered biochar for their practices. Oregon Biochar currently only has one mill processing 10% of their production. Upgrading the milling system, which costs between $150-300k, would at least allow them to double their capacity for powdered biochar, thereby meeting a larger part of the demand from consumers. 

To recap, Microsoft s financial contribution to this project will be used to 1) lower significantly the selling price of biochar and therefore increase the demand from farmers and 2) purchase milling equipment to increase capacity for powder biochar and therefore carbon removal.

Oregon Biochar removal project promotes water conservation practices, soil health enhancement, fertilizer efficiency as well as waste diversion and valorisation. This investment in Oregon Biochar removal project contributes to Microsoft s Climate Pledge, its commitments to diverting waste, increasing water quality and availability, and removing carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously, as well as supporting the preservation of our forest ecosystems. ","The project is owned by Oregon Biochar at 100%. Biomass One LLC is the owner of the biomass power plant and its operator. Oregon Biochar, as a 100% owned subsidiary of the Biomass One power plant, is the sole owner of the biochar produced and its inherent carbon content. Oregon Biochar is also the entity responsible for the sale of the physical biochar, but contracted the project development, sales and marketing for carbon credits to the consulting firm GECA Environnement ( GECA �). As such, GECA is the project developer, sales, marketing and account manager for carbon credits as well as representative of Oregon Biochar for this proposal and on the registry. Puro.earth is the developer of the methodology, the registry and the platform used to reliably quantify the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere. Puro.earth is responsible for the project verification via an independent 3rd party. The verifier which audited Oregon Biochar s plant in June 2021 is Energy Link Services (ELS), an Australian consulting firm. See here the certificate: https://static.puro.earth/live/uploads/tinymce/Suppliers/Oregon_biochar/20210621_Oregon_Biochar_Solutions_Audit_Statement_vF.1.pdf 


GECA Environnement is a leading consulting firm specialized in biochar and its production. The firm has extensive technical knowledge of production processes, technologies and markets for biochar, including the carbon market. In a team of 9 people, 5 hold PhDs, 4 are engineers, 2 have deep expertise in agronomy and 3 are specialized in development and sales and 2 are carbon market experts. The whole team is trained in biochar production and application. The 3 individuals working on this project at GECA are Melissa Leung, director of business development & carbon, William M tivier, Forest Engineer, director of development and product commercialization, and Suzanne Allaire, PhD, soil physicist and biochar expert. 

Melissa Leung has 3 years at GECA, responsible for marketing, business development and carbon. She has expertise in working with and applying the Puro.earth methodology, developing supply and opportunities for biochar producers. William M tivier has developed 2 AFOLU projects under the VCS standard that have generating over 100 000 offsets in the first 5 years and has worked in biomass valorisation in the forestry sector for the past 2 years. Suzanne Allaire was a professor at Laval University for 17 years, specifically on biochar and biochar production before founding GECA Environnement. She is a trained agronomist, environmental engineer and soil physicist with over 100 peer-reviewed articles and 500 invited presentation. 

Karl Strahl is the VP of sales and marketing at Oregon Biochar. His responsibilities include biochar production management, biochar product development and sales and marketing of the physical biochar. He has extensive connections in the agricultural and soil sector throughout the USA which allows him to place, and therefore sequester, large amounts of carbon every year. The Biomass One facility also has its own engineers responsible for the plant and its production.


The management team for this project regroups technical biochar experts, carbon market experts and sales and development experts. The structure as well as the team is already in place to expand Oregon Biochar  biochar production operations quickly and thus secure all planned carbon credits. With the financial support of Microsoft, through a contractual carbon credits purchase agreement, the management will have all the tools to scale up their production capacity. There is no doubt this project can deliver all planned carbon credits, environmental and social benefits presented in the current proposal.
","The Oregon biochar removal project started in October 2020 when GECA presented the opportunity to generate carbon credits to Oregon Biochar. In February 2021, GECA started collecting all the information needed to develop the project, demonstrate additionality and write the Life Cycle analysis (LCA). At the end of April 2021, the project was reviewed for the first time by an independent audit firm (Energy Link Services), at the demand of the Puro.Earth methodology, who asked for some clarifications and corrections in the project s documentation and carbon quantification. On June 21st 2021, ELS released a positive Production Facility and Audit Output Statement for Oregon Biochar s project based on Puro.earth s methodology and requirements for the period of October 2019 to arch 2021 inclusively. 

The project was conceived by GECA, financed by Oregon Biochar themselves and implemented by GECA. It remains managed by GECA, although Oregon Biochar owns the project and participates actively in its development and maintenance.
",6/21/2021,White City,Oregon,USA,800,3000,Yes,1000,4000,1200,5000,1450,6000,1700,7000,2000,8000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,69.4,100,Not relevant - biochar projects are 100% removals.,Yes,Other (please specify),Puro,6.43E+17,,,Yes,,"The most important risk the project faces would be the unforeseen plant issues, whether those are mechanical or regulatory. Most biochar projects contain technology risk, but given the structure of this production, i.e. via a biomass power-plant which has long-term power purchase agreements, the technology risk is extremely low. Of course, the management team s priority is the maintenance of both the project and the plant. All permits are maintained up to date and regulatory aspects respected for both the power plant and the biochar production. If there is an event which leads to the inability of the plant to produce biochar and therefore removal, and which is outside of the control of Oregon Biochar, biomass One or the management team, we request that Microsoft gives the project the authorization to fulfill its commitment via the transfer of carbon credits coming from a project sharing many similarities.

A second risk the project faces relates to feedstock supply. Although many feedstock suppliers, including secondary and tertiary wood processing facilities, have long-term understandings and relationships with the plant, there is a possibility that for some reason, feedstock supply may become more difficult to secure. To mitigate this risk, the plant has several, actually over hundreds, of feedstock suppliers from different industries, including agriculture, urban waste and landscaping, primary, secondary and tertiary wood processors and emergency organizations taking care of wildfires such as FEMA. In addition to that, Oregon Biochar and the plant has the capacity to send their own teams for in-wood clean-ups. Hence, through the variety and multiplication of feedstock suppliers and sources, the project mitigates the risk of running out of feedstock.

The last risk the project faces would concern the usage of biochar. Given that the biochar has not yet been sold to farmers, it is possible that the amount proposed can t be entirely placed in fields or lagoons, especially since those applications require mostly powdered biochar. That being said, agricultural usage is the priority of the project and will always remain the market of choice, taking the majority of Oregon Biochar s biochar. As mentioned higher in this proposal, the revenues from the sale of the carbon credits will be used to 1) decrease the selling price of biochar for farmers and 2) purchase milling equipment. Of course, industrial water filtration is a market in which Oregon Biochar sells its product, so the proportion of biochar going to this application may increase if there is a powdered biochar production bottleneck.
",900,1,"Note that GECA's durability guarantee extends to 1 year after the biochar is put into the soil. This means that for applications not immediately in soil, such as water filtration for example, the guarantee extends to before soil application. 

The durability of the project is determined within the Puro.earth methodology by considering the stability of the produced biochar using H/C and O/C ratios. The H/C ratio for the biochar in this project is of 0.08 and the O/C ratio of 0.05. Based on the Puro.earth methodology and the work by Spokas 2010 (https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/41695/cmt.10.32_spokas.pdf), it is estimated that the half-life of biochars with an O/C ratio smaller than 0.2 be at least of 1000 years. Of course, a half-life is not synonym with permanence, which is why we have conservatively estimated the permanence of this project to at least 1000 years, given the low O/C ratio of the biochar. In fact, from Spokas 2010 again, we can compare the O/C ratio of Oregon Biochar s biochar to that of low-volatile bituminous fossil coal. Additionally, since the final usage of the biochar will be mostly in soils as an amendment for crops, it is assumed that the removal will not undergo unplanned reversal. Simply put, biochar blends into soil and the quantity of soil that would have to be sorted through would be enormous for a small biochar fraction.

GECA is only responsible for the first 12 months after biochar integration in the soil. After the first 12 months, the risk of physical reversal of biochar in soil is negligible (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf).","The project will monitor production, delivery and end of life use of the biochar. This means that buyers of biochar will be made aware that they must alert Oregon Biochar and/or the management team if there are have been events or situations that have led to reversals. These alerts will have to be immediate or as soon as possible, coupled with an evaluation of the amount of biochar lost. From the amount of biochar lost, we can calculate how many carbon removals were reversed. In any case, Oregon Biochar and/or the management team will follow up annually with its buyers to track whether loads of biochar have been burnt and assess the quantity of reversals if such event occurred.

The project management team will then inform the Carbon team at Microsoft of the situation and steps will be taken to ensure that these removals are either removed from carbon accounting or replaced, depending on the situation and based on GECA's Framework.
","There are no intended reversals over the course of this project. In the case when biochar is used in a non-soil application such as for water filtration, Oregon Biochar and the project management team will track the biochar at its end of useful life to ensure that the carbon contained within is not released back into this atmosphere. This means that we will work with the buyers of the biochar to valorize the end-of-life filtration biochar into different products that sequester carbon, such as soil amendment. In the worst case scenario, the biochar would be sent to landfill rather than being burnt (highlight, absolute worst case scenario). 

If there are unavoidable events, such as a fire at the production facility, the removals will not be reversed because the carbon removal is only accounted for from the point of exit from the production facility. That being said, a fire or other similar event at the plant could result in a delay in issuance and delivery of carbon credits given that a part of biochar that was supposed to remove carbon is destroyed. 

In the event of a fire in the hands of the biochar buyer before or during usage which would result in carbon losses, the user shall immediately contact Oregon Biochar and/or the project management team to inform us of the situation. Biochar is generally delivered in truckloads or big bags. If big bags are damaged and destroyed, it is relatively easy to count the missing biochar, the equivalent of which will be removed from the carbon credits production. If a truckload is burnt, then either the weight or the remaining load will be assessed to determined how much carbon was lost or the entire truckload will be deemed lost. In either case, Microsoft will be made aware of the reversal and the management team will take all necessary steps to replace the carbon credits.
","As part of GECA s framework, an on-going communication plan was developed with biochar s buyers allowing GECA and biochar s producers to monitor all intentional/avoidable reversals. Annually, based on the results of the ongoing communication plan, all reversals will be estimated and reported to the audit firm. If these reversals exceed the quantity of carbon credits within the buffer pool, GECA will compensate these carbon removals with carbon removals coming from other projects included within GECA s portfolio or with following year removal allocations from the buffer pools.","There is no buffer pool for the project currently certified under the Puro.earth methodology. However, Puro.earth s methodology enforces a 2,5% reduction factor on all removals to account for uncertainties in the quantification method. 

Unlike forestry-based removals, biochar removals have a very low risk of reversal because once biochar has been applied in soils, it is practically impossible for the carbon to be emitted back into the atmosphere through a reversal event. 

However, to mitigate risks of reversal or unforeseen events, GECA is currently analyzing the opportunity of creating its own buffer pool within GECA s portfolio. The generic idea is that GECA would place annually a percentage of all removals generated within the portfolio into its own buffer pool to compensate its clients in case of reversal. At the end of each financial year, GECA could then proceed to the sale of these removals before they expire. The buffer pool would then be refurnished with newly produced removals. If Microsoft is interested in the implementation of this pool, please let us know.","The percentage of credits put into the buffer pool hasn't yet been decided, but will take into account the needs, frequency of incidents and risk related to the reversals or production delays.",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"The ideal outcome would be for a multi-year offtake agreement including FY22 and 4 additional years. We wish to increase the volume we supply to Microsoft every year, from 800 mtons of CO2 in FY22 to 2000 mtons of CO2 in 2027. We are interested in renewing the initial contract after the first 2 or 3 years, since the project will have a better idea of how much biochar and therefore carbon credits it can produce after 2027. The reason why we would consider 5 years initially is because of uncertainties relating to both the biochar market and the time at which the plant will have the ability to scale up powdered biochar production. Once these two elements are better known, we will be comfortable committing to renewing terms. Our timeline to arrange this offtake would start now, in August 2021 until Q2 2022.","The price increases from FY22 up to FY24 reflect estimates of increasing of market growth (with demand surpassing supply), inflation and labor costs. If Microsoft is to sign a multi-year agreement with GECA for Oregon Biochar, GECA will deliver the carbon removals at the listed price through FY24, even if the market changes and market prices increase. 
If Microsoft decides to choose Oregon Biochar as a carbon removal supplier but signs spot purchase agreements year-by-year, then the market price will be the price at which carbon removal will be sold and delivered. 

",,,,,"SDG 2: In manure lagoons, biochar usage decreases the amount of mixing and pumping by tractors and reduces the need for fresh water utilization. The lagoon water after biochar treatment is much cleaner than in regular practices, which allows us to use more of this recycled water, which contains biochar, into crops. Using biochar in soils reduces the amount of freshwater used for irrigation (reported at around 10% by farmers in the project trial), the amount of fertilizers used (reported by farmers at around 20%), replaces other soil amendments that are less sustainable, increase pest and disease resistance and contributes to enhancing soil health. Additionally, it brings carbon to soil directly, through the biochar's existing labile carbon, and indirectly, through microorganism growth. Less top soil loss through erosion, less leaching of pesticides and fertilizers are also to be expected. From this year's trial, farmers have reported about 10% crop yield increase in their corn production. Since the biochar is in fact made partly from agricultural residues, using biochar in the field does not only promote sustainable agriculture but also the circular economy in this polluting sector.

SDG 3: Since part of the feedstock being transformed into biochar comes from sources who have previously been open-air burning the material, this controlled and sustainable valorisation reduces the air pollution that would otherwise be emitted as particulate matter and products of incomplete combustion. Local communities in supply regions should therefore breathe better air, an indirect benefit of biomass valorisation into biochar. For farmers working on the lagoons, biochar actually reduces the odor so much that it barely smells like manure anymore. This contributes to better working conditions for farmers and their employees manipulating directly or indirectly this material.

SDG 6: Biochar usage increases the quality of lagoon water, which allows farmers to use more of this recycled water, which contains biochar, into crops, replacing freshwater. So far, farmers have perceived freshwater savings of about 10% in California crops where our project was trialed. If this was implemented in all farms, the freshwater savings could reduce significantly the availability stress during droughts and dry seasons, specifically in regions prone to climate change effects.

SDG 7: Oregon Biochar's biochar is in fact made at the Biomass One power plant, a 100% biomass-powered 30MW facility. In this set-up, biochar and electricity are co-products of woody waste valorisation and ensure consistent biochar as reliable, clean electricity for the area.

SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. Oregon Biochar's project contribute to this SDG via the innovative and sustainable uses for biochar in agricultural and industrial settings. Oregon Biochar plans on converting other biomass facilities to produce biochar, and therefore scale-up this sustainable and effective solution for waste and agricultural problems. 

SDG 12: Oregon Biochar's operations ensure that what is so-called ""waste"" is in fact under-utilized resource that holds and creates value. Instead of landfilling or open-air burning the woody debris, farmers, wood processing facilities, fire departments and other entities send them to the Biomass One facility. Not only does this contribute to the circular economy, it also replaces the fossil energy that would otherwise be consumed by electricity consumers and to manage these ""wastes"".
SDG 13: This project already increases our resilience to climate change impact from the start; by reducing freshwater usage by 10%. Especially in the USA's west coast, particularly in California and Oregon, our project will increase the freshwater available for crisis response, whether that be for drinking water, livestock or crops. California and Oregon are already facing droughts which are becoming more and more pronounced every year, hence this effect will not just impact periods when disaster hit, but everyday life for local communities and farmers. Additionally, by increasing resilience of crops to reduced fertilizer use, we increase the crops' ability to supply quality food if there are limited supplies due to transportation limitations (ex: landslide, road sweep, etc). As mentioned throughout this application, the use of forest fire fuel and burnt wood reduces the risk of forest fires in Oregon Biochar's area, which have been producing disastrous consequences for local communities affected. By recovering the biomass of burnt trees, Oregon biochar helps clean forest floors of its fuel and thus reduces the risk of development of future fires. This is an important feature of the project co-benefits as forest fires are bound to be more frequent in the state of Oregon as climate changes evolve. By using secondary wood product waste to produce biochar, Oregon Biochar Solution has found a way to valorize the quantity of wood that was formerly used by the pulp and paper industry while considerably limiting the quantities of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere by storing the carbon for centuries in soils.Finally, by using residual biomass and forest residues that are dead or prone to diseases, Oregon Biochar's project should decrease the risk of pest and disease spreading through forest land. All pests, diseases and other pathogens from the feedstock, including potentially wood-boring beetles, are destroyed in the process of making biochar.

SDG 15: As mentioned prior, part of the feedstock that Oregon Biochar uses for the production of its biochar is burnt wood from forest fires as well as forest fire fuel, i.e. biomass that is removed by forest managers to reduce forest fire risks. If Oregon Biochar did not take in this material, it would most likely be sent to the landfill, burnt in a controlled area or piled up somewhere. On the other hand, using biochar in agricultural practices as described higher contributes to reducing land degradation and building up carbon in soil through its effects on microbial life, erosion, leaching and fertilizer use. 
","Biochar in soils brings various beneficial effects including water usage reduction, fertilizer usage reduction, yield increases, increased microbial communities, prevents nutrient run-offs and increase soil stability. Of these co-benefits, freshwater and irrigation savings, fertilizer usage reductions and yield increases will be tracked based on farmer input and feedback as well as through some partner measurements. In replacement of fossil activated carbon, the benefits are increased sorption for certain contaminants and reduced emissions from fossil coal mining. The first co-benefit for filtration may not be tracked given the sensitivity of the information and variability of the results as it related to the filtered media itself. The second co-benefit can be estimated by calculations.",The project provides high-quality jobs for the local community and brings awareness to environmental issues by employee training and its waste valorisation operation.,"As many other criteria, local stakeholders  consultation requirements vary from one standard to another. GECA is currently working on a framework that will serve as a guideline to follow in order to standardize all projects. This framework is composed of a set of criteria as well as their respective requirements that GECA considers necessary to respect to ensure the quality of its carbon removals. Most of the criteria and requirements are taken from existing standards, but some also come from Carbon Direct s document untitled  Criteria for high-quality carbon dioxide removal �. By using its framework to develop carbon-removal projects, GECA will not only respect a specific standard s set of criteria and requirements to be officially certified under such standard but will go beyond to deliver the highest-quality carbon removal credits produced from biochar projects. 

A section of GECA s framework is dedicated to  Safeguards �, which presents mechanisms to engage local stakeholders and implement on-going communications with them. This section also lists the procedures or methods used for documenting the outcomes of the local stakeholder consultation and the steps taken to mitigate any potential negative impacts due to biochar-based projects (environmental, socio-economic).  

Furthermore, the projects under GECA s Framework must adhere to high production standards so that no damage is done to the environment on an air, soil, water, biodiversity and human level. Pyrolysis projects must operate high-technological systems to prevent the production and release of toxic gases and effluents. All plants must conform to environmental regulations put in place by the EPA (or equivalent) and local authorities, and answer to public hearing for permit approbation when applicable. Additionally, biochar usages must absolutely be in line with the permitted applications based on biochar properties as well as laws and regulations. GECA s Framework includes a section on the methodology used to track and monitor biochar usage.

GECA is on the review committee of two methodologies currently in development for the production of biochar and its use in soils and non-soils applications (VERRA and Climate Action Reserve). By keeping itself aware of any development regarding biochar s methodologies, GECA will be able to update its framework over time if new criteria or requirements are considered relevant for its portfolio. 

Oregon Biochar's project falls under this framework even if it was developed prior to its completion and implementation. ",,,,,,
GECA Environnement,No,North America s largest biochar-based CO2 removals portfolio,GECAs portfolio of biochar-based projects,Biochar,,,,"The high price of biochar has always constituted an obstacle to the growth of the industry until now. In response to the increasing prevalence of  net zero � commitments by companies, GECA has developed an expertise in the development of carbon-removal projects to provide the financial incentive needed for biochar project developers to scale their production. In short, the finance of carbon lowers the price of biochar which in turn becomes accessible to local farmers to use it as soils amendment in their farms. 

GECA has built a portfolio of 12 biochar-based projects (10 in US, 1 in Puerto Rico and 1 in Canada (on First Nation land)) that will initiate high-quality carbon removals this year or within 3 years. The goal of this portfolio is to bring climate finance to the biochar industry in order to scale the usage of production in agriculture. By creating its own project portfolio, GECA has simultaneously established its own framework, ensuring projects are certified under existing industry standards and adhere to additional criteria essential for high-quality carbon dioxide removal, such as those described by Carbon Direct. GECA s portfolio is composed of projects that are either operational, planned, or under development. This portfolio is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years as more biochar projects will be added to it, provided they respect GECA s framework.

GECA s portfolio is a set of projects aimed at removing carbon through the production of biochar and its application in agriculture as well as alternative non-energy sectors. Through its aggregation of projects, GECA's portfolio allows companies wishing to offset their GHG emissions with high-quality carbon removals to invest in the development of several carbon-removal projects scattered across North America. Just like any investment fund, GECA's portfolio allows companies to diversify their risk while benefiting from all the positive impacts that each project brings on a social, economic and environmental scale.

Without Microsoft  climate finance as a multi-year purchase agreements or other form, the level at which the portfolio could scale up will not reflect the predicted removal supply within the next 10 years. 

A second risk would be if production facilities encountered equipment issues, whether due to a natural risk (hurricane, fires, etc) or an unnatural risk (equipment breaking, default in manufacturing, etc). Of course, be assured that all projects have the duty of maintaining to the highest standard their production facility. If there is an event which leads to the inability of a plant to produce biochar and therefore removal, GECA will temporarily withdraw the project from its portfolio until the plant starts producing biochar again. In the meantime, GECA would fulfill its commitment to Microsoft via the transfer of carbon removals coming from another project within GECA s portfolio If GECA decides to develop its own buffer pool within its portfolio, GECA would have access to removals in order to compensate Microsoft.

The last risk projects within GECA s portfolio face would concern the usage of biochar. Given that the biochar has not yet been sold to farmers or to any other buyer from alternative non-energy sectors, it is possible that the expected amounts of biochar production can t be entirely placed for the targeted applications. That being said, agricultural usage is the priority for most projects within GECA s portfolio and will always remain the market of choice. All other markets that will be considered are of course eligible for carbon removal production, and first uses that don t result in soil applications will be monitored until they reach a final sequestration usage. As an example, biochar that is used in industrial water filtration for nutrient interception will be redirected to soil after its useful lifespan in the first application. 
",500,1,"Note that GECA's durability guarantee extends to 1 year after the biochar is put into the soil. This means that for applications not immediately in soil, such as water filtration for example, the guarantee extends to before soil application.

The durability of biochar-based projects included within GECA s portfolio is determined through the Puro.Earth methodology by considering the stability of the produced biochar using its H/C and O/C ratios (https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/41695/cmt.10.32_spokas.pdf). To be considered high-quality carbon credits, a sequestered ton of carbon dioxide must be kept out of the atmosphere for 100 years (or less, in some cases) to be considered  permanent � (https://www.offsetguide.org/high-quality-offsets/permanence/). We can say that, at minimum, the biochar produced by GECA s portfolio projects permanently removes carbon from the atmosphere for many hundreds of years. Additionally, since the final usage of the biochar will be mostly in soils as an amendment for crops, it is assumed that the removal will not undergo unplanned reversal. Simply put, biochar blends into soil and the quantity of soil that would have to be sorted through to remove the biochar would be enormous. Reversal risks from natural sources and unnatural sources are negligible.","As part of GECA s framework, an on-going communication plan was developed with biochar s buyers allowing GECA and biochar s producers to monitor all intentional/avoidable reversals. For non-soil applications, GECA and/or the project owner will track the biochar until useful end of life, at which point it will be placed in a soil or other permanent application. Under no circumstances will the removals accounted for in this portfolio's offering be derived from biochar destined to be used in energy.

The project will monitor production, delivery and end of life use of the biochar. This means that buyers of biochar will be made aware that they must alert biochar s producers and/or GECA if there are have been events or situations that have led to reversals. These alerts will have to be immediate or as soon as possible, coupled with an evaluation of the amount of biochar lost. From the amount of biochar lost, GECA will be able to calculate how many carbon removals were reversed. In any case, GECA, with the help of biochar producers, will follow up annually with buyers to track whether loads of biochar have been burnt and assess the quantity of reversals if such event occurred.

Periodically, based on the results of the ongoing communication plan, all reversals will be estimated and reported to the audit firm. If these reversals exceed the quantity of carbon credits within the buffer pool, GECA will compensate these carbon removals with carbon removals coming from other projects included within GECA s portfolio or with following year removal allocations from the buffer pools established via GECA's Framework (in development).

If reversal associated with Microsoft s removals happened, GECA will inform Microsoft of the situation immediately and steps will be taken to ensure that these removals are replaced. 
","There are no intended reversals over the course of this project. In the case when biochar is used in a non-soil application such as for water filtration, biochar s producers and GECA will track the biochar at its end of useful life to ensure that the carbon contained within is not released back into this atmosphere. This means that GECA will work with the buyers of the biochar to valorize the end-of-life filtration biochar into different products that sequester carbon, such as soil amendment. In the worst-case scenario, the biochar would be sent to landfill rather than being burnt (highlight, absolute worst case scenario). 

If there are unavoidable events, such as a fire at the production facility, the removals will not be reversed because the carbon removal is only accounted for from the point of exit from the production facility. That being said, a fire or other similar event at the plant could result in a delay in issuance and delivery of carbon credits given that a part of biochar that was supposed to remove carbon is destroyed, or production capacity reduced. 

In the event of a fire in the hands of the biochar buyer before or during usage which would result in carbon losses, the user shall immediately contact biochar s producer or GECA to inform them of the situation. Biochar is generally delivered in truckloads or big bags. If big bags are damaged and destroyed, it is relatively easy to count the missing biochar, the equivalent of which will be removed from the carbon credits production. If a truckload is burnt, then either the weight or the remaining load will be assessed to determined how much carbon was lost or the entire truckload will be deemed lost. In either case, Microsoft will be made aware of the reversal and the management team will take all necessary steps to replace the carbon credits.","Annually, based on the results of the ongoing communication plan, all reversals will be estimated and reported to the audit firm. If these reversals exceed the quantity of carbon credits within the buffer pool, GECA will compensate these carbon removals with carbon removals coming from other projects included within GECA s portfolio or with following year removal allocations from the buffer pools.","There is no buffer pool for the project currently certified under the Puro.earth methodology. However, Puro.earth s methodology enforces a 2,5% reduction factor on all removals to account for uncertainties in the quantification method. 

Unlike forestry-based removals, biochar removals have a very low risk of reversal because once biochar has been applied in soils, it is practically impossible for the carbon to be emitted back into the atmosphere through a reversal event. 

GECA is currently analyzing the opportunity of creating its own buffer pool within GECA s portfolio. The generic idea is that GECA would place annually a percentage of all removals generated within the portfolio into its own buffer pool to compensate its clients in case of reversal. At the end of each financial year, GECA could then proceed to the sale of these removals before they expire, if they were not needed. The buffer pool would then be refurnished with newly produced removals. The buffer pool would then be refurnished with newly produced removals. If Microsoft is interested in the implementation of this pool, please let us know.","The percentage of credits put into the buffer pool hasn't yet been decided, but will take into account the needs, frequency of incidents and risk related to the reversals or production delays.",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"The ideal outcome would be for a multi-year offtake agreement including FY22 and 4 additional years. We wish to increase the volume we supply to Microsoft every year, from 5 000 mtons of CO2 in FY22 to 20 000 mtons of CO2 in 2027. We are interested in renewing the initial contract after the first 2 or 3 years, since GECA will have a better idea of how much biochar is being produced by the projects included within its portfolio and therefore how many removals are available to market. The reason why we would not consider more than 5 years initially is because of uncertainties relating to both the biochar market and the time at which biochar s production facilities will have the ability to scale up their production. Once these two elements are better known, GECA will be comfortable committing to renewing terms. GECA s timeline to arrange this offtake would start now, in August 2021 until Q2 2022, although we expect the portfolio to be allocated by the end of the 2021 year.","The price increases from FY22 up to FY24 reflect how GECA estimates that the carbon market will grow in the coming years, with a demand for removals greatly surpassing the offer, as well as inflation and shortage of labor. If Microsoft is to sign a multi-year agreement with GECA for its portfolio, GECA will deliver the carbon removals at the listed price through FY24, even if the market changes and market prices increase. 

If Microsoft decides to choose GECA s portfolio as a carbon removal supplier but signs spot purchase agreements year-by-year, then the market price will be the price at which carbon removal will be sold and delivered. 
",,,,,"Under GECA s framework, each project must clearly state which environmental and socio-economic impacts will the project have on local stakeholders or nearby communities. 

 ¢	Every carbon-removal project within GECA s portfolio meets sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2 (End Hunger), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production, 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land). Some projects also contribute to additional SDGs, such as the 6th (Clean Water and Sanitation), the 7th (Affordable and Clean Energy) and the 11th (Sustainable Cities and Communities) goal, to name a few. 
 ¢	Transforming waste biomass that is most often left to decay, burnt or landfilled into biochar reduces the environmental pollution created where such practice is applied. For example, these biomasses will not contribute to landfill leaching into the water table, they will not contribute to smoke hazards by being burnt naturally (wildfires) or by man (ag burning) and allows the removal of carbon from the atmosphere.
 ¢	Biochar used in agriculture procures many co-benefits such as water usage reduction, fertilizer usage reduction, yield increases, increased microbial communities, prevents nutrient run-offs and increase soil stability. 
 ¢	These projects create high-quality jobs in the environmental sector for local communities surrounding the facilities. Biochar has the potential to scale up rapidly in the next few years and provide important financial revenue to different local industries, organizations and communities through the sales of carbon removals, biochar and other pyrolytic products. 
","For now, co-benefits associated with the use of biochar in soils are not all measured. However, GECA s framework requires each project within its portfolio to develop an on-going communication plan with their biochar buyers. Therefore, GECA will have access to some users who wish to monitor and showcase the impact biochar has had on some of the most important metrics in agriculture, including water and fertilizer usage as well as crop yields. Note that not all farmers will be willing to share these details with the project, given the sensitivity of such information. ","All projects provide high-quality jobs for local communities and bring awareness to environmental issues through employee training and its waste valorisation operations. Most projects create incentives for communities to operate sustainable businesses in parallel with the projects under this portfolio, for example in agriculture or forestry where waste is most often burnt or landfilled. Additionally, our portfolio includes projects in climate-disturbed regions and in at-risk or isolated communities. Certain projects are also located in communities where little renewable electricity is provided.

Finally, the usage of biochar in agriculture should increase the frequency of sustainable practices in this industry. Farmers that didn't previously have access to biochar for economic reasons should be able to access it, giving them an opportunity to switch to regenerative agriculture, especially for smaller conventional farmers. Local communities should benefit greatly from this project through the reduction of fertilizer and of freshwater usage.","As many other criteria, local stakeholders  consultation requirements vary from one standard to another. Because GECA will develop the majority of carbon projects included in its portfolio over the coming months and might use different methodologies from multiple standards, GECA is currently working on a framework that will serve as a guideline to follow in order to standardize all projects. This framework is composed of a set of criteria as well as their respective requirements that GECA considers necessary to respect to ensure the quality of its carbon removals. Most of the criteria and requirements are taken from existing standards, but some also come from Carbon Direct s document untitled  Criteria for high-quality carbon dioxide removal �. By using its framework to develop carbon-removal projects, GECA will not only respect a specific standard s set of criteria and requirements to be officially certified under such standard but will go beyond to deliver the highest-quality carbon removal credits produced from biochar projects. 

A section of GECA s framework is dedicated to  Safeguards �, which presents mechanisms to engage local stakeholders and implement on-going communications with them. This section also lists the procedures or methods used for documenting the outcomes of the local stakeholder consultation and the steps taken to mitigate any potential negative impacts due to biochar-based projects (environmental, socio-economic).  

Furthermore, the projects under GECA s portfolio must adhere to high production standards so that no damage is done to the environment on an air, soil, water, biodiversity and human level. Pyrolysis projects in this portfolio must operate high-technological systems to prevent the production and release of toxic gases and effluents. All plants must conform to environmental regulations put in place by the EPA (or equivalent) and local authorities, and answer to public hearing for permit approbation when applicable. Additionally, biochar usages must absolutely be in line with the permitted applications based on biochar properties as well as laws and regulations. GECA s framework includes a section on the methodology used to track and monitor biochar usage.

GECA is on the review committee of two methodologies currently in development for the production of biochar and its use in soils and non-soils applications (VERRA and Climate Action Reserve). By keeping itself aware of any development regarding biochar s methodologies, GECA will be able to update its framework over time if new criteria or requirements are considered relevant for its portfolio. 

Active projects that have been through certification before the implementation of GECA's internal Framework must respect the Framework's requirements and methodology. There may be a delay in the implementation of the various methodologies, but will be in place before the first delivery (FY22) to Microsoft.",,,,,,

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical base-line. To not make a landowner wait 5-years for any carbon payments, Bcarbon allows a highly conservative and certified forward looking carbon storage assessment, based on several parameters: land management, vegetation assessment and ranch location (rain and soil), before the actual increase is measured in year-5.
",Yes,Other (please specify),BCarbon,N/A,,,No,"BCarbon will certify our soil carbon storage - These are not credits based on avoiding additional emissions. The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification
","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.
",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project are distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Annual monitoring
Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project are distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will compensate Microsoft with alternative BCarbon certified credits from its portfolio of participating C-ranches, outside the Microsoft project, to compensate for any unintentional/unavoidable reversals. As an alternative, in agreement with Microsoft, participating ranchers will be offered the potential opportune to compensate for reversals in the next annual storage period.

Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason. The protection of the diverse portfolio will provide resilience against some losses.
","The buffer pool, mandate and maintained by the BCarbon registry, is composed of credits of atmospheric carbon removal only, certified under Bcarbon. The buffer pool will contain credits from every project registered under Bcarbon.

BCarbon will document their credit buffer procedures before the end of 2021.",10%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Grassroots Carbon aims to make it easier for Microsoft to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches it needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.

","Soil Carbon measurements will be executed by a qualified contractor in line with Vera VMD0021, but certified under the BCarbon standard. BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards. BCarbon has just been rated by a team of researchers from the University of Wyoming, in a Microsoft funded study, evaluating 14 soil carbon certification standards. BCarbon was one of only two methodologies to be awarded the highest rating. [J Zelikova, F Chay, J Freeman, D Cullenward (2021)  A buyer s guide to soil carbon offsets � CarbonPlan :https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer]
Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward looking pre-assessment, will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",8215,2.47,0,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In additional we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects. 
DEI is a focal point of our efforts. Additionally, we are working to be economically inclusive of smaller ranches that tend to get cut out of SOC projects.

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical base-line.

The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification.","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.
",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Annual monitoring
Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.","Annual monitoring

Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks.

We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches it needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase.

Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact.

Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition, we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects. 
DEI is a focal point of our efforts. Additionally, we are working to be economically inclusive of smaller ranches that tend to get cut out of SOC projects.","We have not identified any harms of unintended negative consequences, neither have our corporate clients when they executed their due diligence process.",,,,,,

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical base-line.

The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification.","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.
",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.","Annual monitoring

As an alternative, in agreement with Microsoft, participating ranchers will be offered the potential opportune to compensate for reversals in the next annual storage period.

Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason. The protection of the diverse portfolio will provide resilience against some losses.","The buffer pool, mandate and maintained by the BCarbon registry, is composed of credits of atmospheric carbon removal only, certified under Bcarbon.

We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches it needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.
We are able to offer flexibility and annual growth in capacity if that would be of value to Microsoft.","Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will be able to offer price discounts for larger storage amounts and longer term commitments, relative to a single FY22 purchase of carbon credits.

BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards. BCarbon has just been rated by a team of researchers from the University of Wyoming, in a Microsoft funded study, evaluating 14 soil carbon certification standards.

Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward looking pre-assessment, will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",3561,2.47,0,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur.

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical base-line. To not make a landowner wait 5-years for any carbon payments, Bcarbon allows a highly conservative and certified forward looking carbon storage assessment, based on several parameters: land management, vegetation assessment and ranch location (rain and soil), before the actual increase is measured in year-5.",Yes,Other (please specify),BCarbon,N/A,,,No,"BCarbon will certify our soil carbon storage - These are not credits based on avoiding additional emissions. The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Annual monitoring
Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.","Annual monitoring

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project are distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will compensate Microsoft with alternative BCarbon certified credits from its portfolio of participating C-ranches, outside the Microsoft project, to compensate for any unintentional/unavoidable reversals. As an alternative, in agreement with Microsoft, participating ranchers will be offered the potential opportune to compensate for reversals in the next annual storage period.
Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason. The protection of the diverse portfolio will provide resilience against some losses.","The buffer pool, mandate and maintained by the BCarbon registry, is composed of credits of atmospheric carbon removal only, certified under Bcarbon. The buffer pool will contain credits from every project registered under Bcarbon.
The policies and procedures to allocate the use of buffer credits in case of project reversal has not been established yet. BCarbon will document their credit buffer procedures before the end of 2021.
",10%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Grassroots Carbon aims to make it easier for Microsoft to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches it needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.
We are able to offer flexibility and annual growth in capacity if that would be of value to Microsoft.","Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will be able to offer price discounts for larger storage amounts and longer term commitments, relative to a single FY22 purchase of carbon credits.

GRC will be able to deliver 200  “ 300 ktCO2 storage credits in FY22.
For higher amounts we will need to discuss delivery terms and payment terms in more detail to ensure we can acquire resources in a timely fashion.
","Soil Carbon measurements will be executed by a qualified contractor in line with Vera VMD0021, but certified under the BCarbon standard. BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards. BCarbon has just been rated by a team of researchers from the University of Wyoming, in a Microsoft funded study, evaluating 14 soil carbon certification standards. BCarbon was one of only two methodologies to be awarded the highest rating. [J Zelikova, F Chay, J Freeman, D Cullenward (2021)  A buyer s guide to soil carbon offsets � CarbonPlan :https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer]
Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward looking pre-assessment, will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",2792,2.47,0,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition, we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects. 
DEI is a focal point of our efforts. Additionally, we are working to be economically inclusive of smaller ranches that tend to get cut out of SOC projects.","We have not identified any harms of unintended negative consequences, neither have our corporate clients when they executed their due diligence process.",,,,,,

We anticipate that this will lead to at least 2 large multi-year soil carbon storage projects.",10/1/2021,"At this stage in the proposal application process the ranches are numbered and additional data about ranches are hidden to meet our data privacy requirements.  Obviously, we would be happy to provide further details and answer any questions about these ranches when this project is selected for further due diligence.",Texas,USA,6800,6800,Yes,6800,,6800,,6800,,6800,,6800,,6800,,6800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,100,100,"Grassroots Carbon [GRC] selected to use the novel BCarbon standard, because this standard enables very high-quality credits, at a scale that matters, because the standard makes it easier for landowners to participate.

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical base-line. To not make a landowner wait 5-years for any carbon payments, Bcarbon allows a highly conservative and certified forward looking carbon storage assessment, based on several parameters: land management, vegetation assessment and ranch location (rain and soil), before the actual increase is measured in year-5.
",Yes,Other (please specify),BCarbon,N/A,,,No,"BCarbon will certify our soil carbon storage - These are not credits based on avoiding additional emissions. The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification
","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.
",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Annual monitoring
Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.","Annual monitoring

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project are distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will compensate Microsoft with alternative BCarbon certified credits from its portfolio of participating C-ranches, outside the Microsoft project, to compensate for any unintentional/unavoidable reversals. As an alternative, in agreement with Microsoft, participating ranchers will be offered the potential opportune to compensate for reversals in the next annual storage period.

Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason. The protection of the diverse portfolio will provide resilience against some losses.","The buffer pool, mandate and maintained by the BCarbon registry, is composed of credits of atmospheric carbon removal only, certified under Bcarbon. The buffer pool will contain credits from every project registered under Bcarbon.
The policies and procedures to allocate the use of buffer credits in case of project reversal has not been established yet. BCarbon will document their credit buffer procedures before the end of 2021.
",10%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Grassroots Carbon aims to make it easier for Microsoft to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches it needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.
We are able to offer flexibility and annual growth in capacity if that would be of value to Microsoft.","Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will be able to offer price discounts for larger storage amounts and longer term commitments, relative to a single FY22 purchase of carbon credits.

GRC will be able to deliver 200  “ 300 ktCO2 storage credits in FY22.
For higher amounts we will need to discuss delivery terms and payment terms in more detail to ensure we can acquire resources in a timely fashion.","Soil Carbon measurements will be executed by a qualified contractor in line with Vera VMD0021, but certified under the BCarbon standard. BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards. BCarbon has just been rated by a team of researchers from the University of Wyoming, in a Microsoft funded study, evaluating 14 soil carbon certification standards. BCarbon was one of only two methodologies to be awarded the highest rating. [J Zelikova, F Chay, J Freeman, D Cullenward (2021)  A buyer s guide to soil carbon offsets � CarbonPlan :https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer]
Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward looking pre-assessment, will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",2751,1,0,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition, we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects. 
DEI is a focal point of our efforts. Additionally, we are working to be economically inclusive of smaller ranches that tend to get cut out of SOC projects.","We have not identified any harms of unintended negative consequences, neither have our corporate clients when they executed their due diligence process.",,,,,,

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Annual monitoring
Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will compensate Microsoft with alternative BCarbon certified credits from its portfolio of participating C-ranches, outside the Microsoft project, to compensate for any unintentional/unavoidable reversals. As an alternative, in agreement with Microsoft, participating ranchers will be offered the potential opportune to compensate for reversals in the next annual storage period.

Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason. The protection of the diverse portfolio will provide resilience against some losses.","The buffer pool, mandate and maintained by the BCarbon registry, is composed of credits of atmospheric carbon removal only, certified under Bcarbon.

We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches it needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.
We are able to offer flexibility and annual growth in capacity if that would be of value to Microsoft.","Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will be able to offer price discounts for larger storage amounts and longer term commitments, relative to a single FY22 purchase of carbon credits.

For higher amounts we will need to discuss delivery terms and payment terms in more detail to ensure we can acquire resources in a timely fashion.","Soil Carbon measurements will be executed by a qualified contractor in line with Vera VMD0021, but certified under the BCarbon standard. BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards. BCarbon has just been rated by a team of researchers from the University of Wyoming, in a Microsoft funded study, evaluating 14 soil carbon certification standards. BCarbon was one of only two methodologies to be awarded the highest rating. [J Zelikova, F Chay, J Freeman, D Cullenward (2021)  A buyer s guide to soil carbon offsets � CarbonPlan :https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer]
Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward looking pre-assessment, will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",2509,2.47,0,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition, we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects.

For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.","Intentional/avoidable reversals are mitigated by the following controls:

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will compensate Microsoft with alternative BCarbon certified credits from its portfolio of participating C-ranches, outside the Microsoft project, to compensate for any unintentional/unavoidable reversals. As an alternative, in agreement with Microsoft, participating ranchers will be offered the potential opportune to compensate for reversals in the next annual storage period.

Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason. The protection of the diverse portfolio will provide resilience against some losses.","The buffer pool, mandate and maintained by the BCarbon registry, is composed of credits of atmospheric carbon removal only, certified under Bcarbon. The buffer pool will contain credits from every project registered under Bcarbon.

",10%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Grassroots Carbon aims to make it easier for Microsoft to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches it needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.
We are able to offer flexibility and annual growth in capacity if that would be of value to Microsoft.
","Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will be able to offer price discounts for larger storage amounts and longer term commitments, relative to a single FY22 purchase of carbon credits.

GRC will be able to deliver 200  “ 300 ktCO2 storage credits in FY22.
For higher amounts we will need to discuss delivery terms and payment terms in more detail to ensure we can acquire resources in a timely fashion.","Soil Carbon measurements will be executed by a qualified contractor in line with Vera VMD0021, but certified under the BCarbon standard. BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards. BCarbon has just been rated by a team of researchers from the University of Wyoming, in a Microsoft funded study, evaluating 14 soil carbon certification standards. BCarbon was one of only two methodologies to be awarded the highest rating. [J Zelikova, F Chay, J Freeman, D Cullenward (2021)  A buyer s guide to soil carbon offsets � CarbonPlan :https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer]
Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward looking pre-assessment, will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",4937,2.47,0,"Co-Benefits. List the measurable co-benefits of this project in the following categories: water  stewardship, waste reduction, ecosystem protection, social equity and justice, and climate resilience. You  may wish to note any alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals and any other standards (i.e.,  Gold Standard, SDVista, FSC, Fair Trade). 
Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition, we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects. 
DEI is a focal point of our efforts. Additionally, we are working to be economically inclusive of smaller ranches that tend to get cut out of SOC projects.","We have not identified any harms of unintended negative consequences, neither have our corporate clients when they executed their due diligence process.",,,,,,

The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed.

These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Annual monitoring
Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.

BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards.

Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward looking pre-assessment, will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.
",9752,2.47,0,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition, we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects.

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical base-line.

The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification.","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.","Annual monitoring

Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward looking pre-assessment, will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",8660,2.47,0,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition, we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects.

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical base-line.

The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism in the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries, and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social, and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, this makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Annual monitoring
Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.","Annual monitoring

Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason.

We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches it needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.

The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards.

Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property. The number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 
The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified.

Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input.

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical base-line.

The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits, while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including: project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 are being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification.
","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increases, but many factors do play a role.

Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward-looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism towards the carbon market.

Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.

Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual re-verification and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.
",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short compared to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally fewer inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same area of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the chance for a reversal to conventional practices is almost nil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners are paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, This makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of droughts, the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, droughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more drought-resistant. So, droughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project is distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.

This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.

Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will compensate Microsoft with alternative BCarbon certified credits from its portfolio of participating C-ranches, outside the Microsoft project, to compensate for any unintentional/unavoidable reversals. As an alternative, in agreement with Microsoft, participating ranchers will be offered the potential opportune to compensate for reversals in the next annual storage period.","The buffer pool, mandate and maintained by the BCarbon registry, is composed of credits of atmospheric carbon removal only, certified under Bcarbon. The buffer pool will contain credits from every project registered under Bcarbon.
The policies and procedures to allocate the use of buffer credits in case of project reversal have not been established yet. BCarbon will document its credit buffer procedures before the end of 2021.
Besides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in different regions and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against the loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason. The protection of the diverse portfolio will provide resilience against some losses.
",10%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Grassroots Carbon aims to make it easier for Microsoft to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches its needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constrained by the availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews, and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.
We are able to offer flexibility and annual growth in a capacity if that would be of value to Microsoft.
","Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will be able to offer price discounts for larger storage amounts and longer term commitments, relative to a single FY22 purchase of carbon credits.

GRC will be able to deliver 200  “ 300 ktCO2 storage credits in FY22.
For higher amounts we will need to discuss delivery terms and payment terms in more detail to ensure we can acquire resources in a timely fashion.
","Soil Carbon measurements will be executed by a qualified contractor in line with Vera VMD0021, but certified under the BCarbon standard. BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards. BCarbon has just been rated by a team of researchers from the University of Wyoming, in a Microsoft-funded study, evaluating 14 soil carbon certification standards. BCarbon was one of only two methodologies to be awarded the highest rating. [J Zelikova, F Chay, J Freeman, D Cullenward (2021)  A buyer s guide to soil carbon offsets � CarbonPlan :https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer]
Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property.
the amount of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 

The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk-density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 

The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.

The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator, and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward-looking pre-assessment will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",9465,2.47,n/a,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 

Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 

Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 

Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include: vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition. we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Soil carbon storage under the BCarbon standard is defined as  the increase in below-ground carbon mass, that is achieved over time through the application of new or continuing land management practices.
Using the BCarbon standard we solely provide credits based on measured atmospheric carbon drawdown and storage and will not include avoiding emissions. 

The BCarbon measurement protocol requires rigorous physical sampling 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon does not use a hypothetical baseline. To not make a landowner wait for 5-years for any carbon payments, Bcarbon allows a highly conservative and certified forward-looking carbon storage assessment, based on several parameters: land management, vegetation assessment, and ranch location (rain and soil), before the actual increase is measured in year-5.
",Yes,Other (please specify),BCarbon,N/A,,,No,"BCarbon will certify our soil carbon storage - These are not credits based on avoiding additional emissions. The measurement protocol is based on taking physical measurements of the soil 1 meter deep, in line with Verra VMD0021. BCarbon will then independently certify the credits while retaining a third-party verifier to validate the project. 

The 3rd party verifier, currently GSI: [www.gsi-net.com], will execute a detailed verification of the compliance of the project with the BCarbon standards, including project scope, boundaries, stratification, sampling plan, sampling execution, laboratory analysis, data analysis, and statistics. The 3rd party verifier will also verify and audit the conservative forward-looking carbon storage assessment, under BCarbon, till the 2nd series of measurements in year-5 is being executed. BCarbon mandates a 2nd series of soil carbon measurements in year 5 of the project, to measure the absolute increase in soil carbon storage. BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon.

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator and land management indicator approach to soil health.
Using PastureMap, our proprietary rotational grazing management software tool, we can continually monitor landowner grazing management activity on their ranches. This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification.
","1) Ranch stores less carbon than anticipated.
It is well known that regenerative land management practices can lead to high soil carbon increase, but many factors do play a role.
Mitigation: The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward-looking assessment remains very conservative.

2) Landowners will not sign a carbon storage agreement with GRC, due to deals offered by our competitors, or a distrust and skepticism of the carbon market.
Mitigation: GRC mitigates this risk by offering transparency and high landowner value.


3) Extreme weather conditions can lead to lower carbon storage
Although grassland fires generally do not negatively impact soil carbon stocks, severe droughts and extreme rainfall can reduce how much additional carbon is stored.
Mitigation:  The BCarbon approach, where credits are based on actual measured carbon storage greatly reduces the risk, as long as the verified and certified forward looking assessment remains very conservative.  Annual verified and verified forward looking assessments will be adjusted on basis of severe weather events.
",100,10,"Technically speaking, soil carbon is more  durable  and longer lasting than other forms of above ground biomass like trees and grassland which can quickly go back into the air with fire (days and years). Depositions of organic matter on the soil surface (e.g. mulch, leaf litter, etc) which contribute less so to the development of soil carbon can and will, if left alone, oxidize back into the air. The most durable forms of soil carbon are created below ground, through the annual senescence of plant roots and through exudates introduced by the plant through its roots, leaves and other tissues. This source of soil organic carbon has slow turnover rates and time periods (decades and centuries). A large percentage of the sequestered soil carbon introduced below ground through these mechanisms will be quite permanent over decades, centuries and millennia if the management practices that create the soil carbon sequestration remain in place. 
For this reason, we believe that the  durability  of soil carbon is primarily an issue of ongoing land management behavior, thus economic, social and political systems, not of the natural  technical  cycle of the carbon itself. Thus, if we successfully implement socio-economic systems that allow nature to work, net soil carbon will increase where levels are currently depleted and will stay in the ground for millennia.

The following contractual agreements are in place to mitigate the risk of reversal.

Landowners are contractually obligated to maintain and protect their land in a way that that promotes and protects soil health and landscape ecological health for ten years after each annual carbon storage delivery. This contractual obligation is mandated by the BCarbon standard and verified in the certification process. Transactions occurring in subsequent years will require renewal of the ten-year commitment, creating a  rolling � ten-year requirement.  
A 10-year commitment is relatively short comparted to the term mandated in other standards. BCarbon arrived at a forward rolling 10-year commitment to find a compromise with what works for landowners and what can be acceptable for carbon storage buyers. Only very few landowners can sign long-term commitments, of 20, 40 or 100 years. Especially small family-owned ranches cannot easily commit to these very long periods. However, the 10-year forward rolling commitment builds the longer-term durability protection gradually. 

The BCarbon registry will maintain a buffer account of 10% of the soil carbon storage credits, to ensure that all credits issued under this standard are protected against failure risks.
Carbon storage buyers will be offered similar replacement soil carbon storage credits, in case offered credits are reversed.

Socio-economic controls:

Ranches managed for soil health and ecological health in a regenerative way are more profitable. These ranches have generally less inputs and more outputs. They grow more forage on the same are of land. Once landowners made the migration to regenerative land management the change for reversal to conventional practices is almost nihil. Plain economics form a solid guarantee for maintaining soil health and this carbon storage. 

Carbon payments, in which landowners ae paid for their soil carbon storage ecological service, further support the focus on soil health and ecological health. In a future scenario where carbon prices might be much higher than today, this can become a key driver for change. 

Weather and fire resistance:

Soil carbon storage is based on soil health and ecological health and the biological processes in the grassland ecosystems. Water is essential for photosynthesis, This makes the soil carbon storage uptake dependent on water availability. In periods of draughts the soil carbon uptake will be lower. However, draughts are not likely to reduce soil carbon levels rapidly. In addition: regenerative ranches with higher soil carbon levels do adsorb much more (8-10 x) water in soil than conventionally managed ranches. They are much more draught resistant. So, draughts will impact the rate of storing additional carbon, but will not easily reduce soil carbon levels.

The portfolio of ranches for this Microsoft project are distributed over a large geographical region. This will reduce the risk of severe weather impacts on the total portfolio of ranches and thus the carbon storage delivery.

Grassland fires are natural and will not negatively impact soil carbon storage levels. This makes soil carbon storage fire resistant, in sharp contrast to forestry carbon storage.","Annual monitoring
Grassroots Carbon will use strict annual monitoring in the period in between the soil carbon measurements. Though ultimately the 5-year measurements (in year 1,5 ,10 and so on) will quantify if a reversal has occurred at any point.
Using PastureMap, the proprietary grazing management software tool offered by Grassroots Carbon, we can monitor cattle rotations on ranches. This provides a valuable insight whether the rancher is frequently rotating cattle, likely in a regenerative grazing management method, or is operating in a conventional grazing management system. This is a valuable monitoring indicator.
This is supplemented by yearly landowner affidavits of activities, landowner photographs of pasture rotations, and most likely selected satellite images of vegetation. 

In addition, we are preparing to utilize selected remote sensing-based methods of practice and soil health verification. We are currently partnering with three innovative startups working in the soil sampling and remote sensing spaces, which would allow us to estimate carbon stocks at will. Grassroots carbon plans to annually select 10% of its ranches for a random audit visit to confirm the ranch is operational and performing grazing practices that support the increase of soil health. These annual verifications will be used by BCarbon in their annual recertification process. Additionally, our yearly assessment of soil carbon sequestered for each ranch incorporates climatic conditions that might lead to unavoidable reversals or less carbon stored.
Buyers will immediately be notified if there is a reversal and as mentioned in the recourse section below, supplemented with credits from other projects.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will compensate Microsoft with alternative BCarbon certified credits from its portfolio of participating C-ranches, outside the Microsoft project, to compensate for any unintentional/unavoidable reversals. As an alternative, in agreement with Microsoft, participating ranchers will be offered the potential opportunity to compensate for reversals in the next annual storage period.

 ƒBesides the Bcarbon buffer, Grassroots Carbon will work with a diverse portfolio of landowners in a different region and states in the USA. This diversity provides natural protection and resilience against loss of carbon stocks. When hundreds of landowners participate there is no significant impact if a few of these landowners will lose carbon for whatever reason. The protection of the diverse portfolio will provide resilience against some losses.
","The buffer pool, mandate and maintained by the BCarbon registry, is composed of credits of atmospheric carbon removal only, certified under Bcarbon. The buffer pool will contain credits from every project registered under Bcarbon.
The policies and procedures to allocate the use of buffer credits in case of project reversal have not been established yet. BCarbon will document its credit buffer procedures before the end of 2021.
",10%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Grassroots Carbon aims to make it easier for Microsoft to reduce its carbon footprint. 
We target to deliver Microsoft the scale that matches its needs and budget for a robust carbon mitigation portfolio of solutions.

Grassroots Carbon prefers to deliver measured carbon credits to a small portfolio of larger buyers (3-5 major clients) to guarantee a robust growth in demand, without being over-dependent on a single client.
Growth in supply is currently constraint by the availability of rancher account managers, soil sampling crews, and soil lab capacity. With security in demand from several clients the required resources can rapidly be obtained. 
A realistic growth in capacity for Microsoft would be the addition of additional projects to the portfolio by ca 200  “ 400 kacres annually, leading to the addition of at least 200 - 400 ktCO2 storage capacity per year, which can lead to a storage capacity for Microsoft of 2.7 MM tCO2/yr by 2030. Faster growth rates will likely be feasible.
Grassroots Carbon prefers to have a multi-year contract for a period of at least 5-years, with the option to extend the contract. This will enable to adequately plan and invest in capacity increase. 
Although there is no absolute minimum capacity we can deliver, we strongly prefer contracts with an annual capacity of at least 100 ktCO2 storage per year.
We are able to offer flexibility and annual growth in capacity if that would be of value to Microsoft.","Grassroots Carbon [GRC] will be able to offer price discounts for larger storage amounts and longer-term commitments, relative to a single FY22 purchase of carbon credits.

GRC will be able to deliver 200  “ 300 ktCO2 storage credits in FY22.
For higher amounts, we will need to discuss delivery terms and payment terms in more detail to ensure we can acquire resources in a timely fashion.
","Soil Carbon measurements will be executed by a qualified contractor in line with Vera VMD0021, but certified under the BCarbon standard. BCarbon is a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and soil carbon storage buyers. The standard allows landowners to monetize soil carbon storage, once measured and certified, as a property right. The standard was developed by a large group of stakeholders around the Baker Institute of Public Policy of Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, but is now an independent non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The standard aims to remove barriers to participation often embedded in carbon standards. BCarbon has just been rated by a team of researchers from the University of Wyoming, in a Microsoft funded study, evaluating 14 soil carbon certification standards. BCarbon was one of only two methodologies to be awarded the highest rating. [J Zelikova, F Chay, J Freeman, D Cullenward (2021)  A buyer s guide to soil carbon offsets � CarbonPlan :https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer]
Soil carbon storage content will be sampled and measured using the Verra VMD0021 standard, in which our measurement contractor will stratify each ranch in the project portfolio, determine a sampling plan for each stratum of the ranch, and sample multiple soil cores to 1m [3ft] depth, according to the sampling plan, to obtain statistical rigorous soil carbon content data for a property.
the number of samples will depend on the number of strata on a ranch. 

The cores will be transported to a certified soil laboratory. The samples will be analyzed in a certified soil laboratory, using the direct combustion method, for each core at sub-samples of 4 different depths of the core. For each sub-sample also the bulk density will be determined. Using the verra VMD0021 standard the total soil carbon content will be determined per strata and then for the project ranch. 
The soil carbon data will be stored in our proprietary PastureMap software in a GIS data platform, to offer total data transparency to landowners and Microsoft.
The soil sampling and measurements will be repeated, depending on the specific location, soil type, and land management techniques, 3-7 years later (average will be 5 years). The second series of measurements is mandatory under the BCarbon standard. The difference between the soil carbon content determined between the first and second measurement series is the actual absolute amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored. These measurements will be repeated every 3-7 years.

Hence, BCarbon will only certify the actual absolute increase in soil carbon. The measurements will be independently verified and certified. 

To not make a landowner wait for a period of 5 years until the exact amount of additional Soil Carbon storage has been determined, BCarbon allows a conservative and certified annual assessment of the increase of the forward-looking increase in soil carbon stock for a period of 1 year. These certified soil carbon storage credits will be offered annually. This conservative annual assessment is based on a landscape indicator, vegetation indicator and land management indicator approach.
When the actual additional carbon storage is determined after the 2nd measurement series in year 5, these carbon storage credits minus the credits that were already offered annually on basis of the conservative forward-looking pre-assessment will be offered. Since the annual certified pre-assessment is deliberately very conservative, it is anticipated that every 5-years a significant additional batch of credits is becoming available. These credits will be offered to Microsoft for purchase on a first right of refusal basis.",16551,2.47,0,"Ecology: 
Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms, and grassland ecology, with diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for hundreds of millions of years. 
Water storage: 
Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbor with conventional grazing. This creates a strong drought resistance of these ranches. 

Grassland cooling effect:
Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact. 

Soil erosion prevention: 
Healthy soils reverse erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. 
Economic resilience:
Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This is based on higher outputs  “ more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. However, the shift to regenerative ranching is prohibitively expensive or considered too risky for many ranchers unless payments based on ecosystem services can occur. 
Community:
 Supporting America s rural communities goes together with environmental justice. Our program engages primarily with independent farmers who are attempting a paradigm shift in their practices that would empower innovation and change. Regenerative methods also allow farmers to obtain economic independence, as they hardly rely on agriculture input and feed providers and have an appreciating asset that benefits us all: the land they steward.","Besides soil carbon measurements we are currently conducting vegetative assessments on all our participating ranches.
These assessments include vegetation density, diversity (plant species), bare soil, fine litter etc.
We actively will use those data to qualitatively assess ecosystem health beyond soil carbon. 

On request, and with additional funding, we propose to measure water infiltration rates at each carbon sampling point. 
In addition, we will work with our carbon ranchers to understand how carbon financing affects their bottom line (which we have been doing since pre-contract discussions) and how remaining transition barriers can be reduced.","The BCarbon standard has a specific DEI principle: Principle 11: Develop a soil carbon credit trading program that embraces diversity of people, is equitable in policy and practice and inclusive of power, people and culture, recognizing that this is an ongoing process that must have full transparency.

Because the BCarbon standard has eliminated some of the barriers for landowners to participate in carbon programs, the standard makes it also easier for smaller landowners to participate.

Grassroots Carbon [GRC] works with various women-owned and managed ranches and is currently in negotiations with various indigenous owned grazing projects. 
DEI is a focal point of our efforts. Additionally, we are working to be economically inclusive of smaller ranches that tend to get cut out of SOC projects

Green Diamond Resource Company,,Increasing carbon sequestration by improving timberland management and forest health,Klamath West IFM,Improved forest management (removal only; not including avoided forest carbon loss),,,,"Klamath West is a unique 185,000-acre Improved Forest Management (IFM) project, with management impacts more akin to a Reforestation project. Rather than preventing hypothetical removals as in a traditional IFM project, all carbon removals in Klamath West are achieved through tree growth.    Green Diamond acquired this forestland in 2014. The forest had suffered from a long period of over-harvesting, dating back through several ownership groups. This had brought carbon stocks significantly below the ARB common practice baseline. Much of the forest also had an overabundance of small trees, which increased risk of fire and disease.  Green Diamond saw an opportunity to use carbon projects to rehabilitate the forest. We established a baseline using the High Stocking Reference (HSR) option of the CARB IFM protocol. Because the HSR baseline is below common practice, carbon credits become available as new growth occurs. The agreement is that the stocking on the forest will not decrease below the level at which the last carbon removal is captured.  The future truly looks different than the past. These removals are sustained at higher levels through the project life (25 years) and for the subsequent 100 years of monitoring.    Carbon project revenues have facilitated and accelerated Green Diamond’s management changes, in particular: extending rotation ages, thinning to reduce tree density, and using silviculture to maximize long-term forest growth.  We are managing to increase forest carbon stocks to ten times what they were when we purchased them.  These management changes have significant near-term financial costs that will yield healthier and more sustainable timber resources in the long-term.  Future harvests will in turn support a local economic ecosystem.     Green Diamond has a commitment to long-term sustained forest growth, but revenue from spot sales of carbon credits does not wholly replace the opportunity cost of deferring timber harvest.  A longer-term offtake agreement with Microsoft at set prices provides the certainty that allows us to continue the forest regrowth process and removes the risk that we must slow down forest health work when carbon prices drop.    Green Diamond partnerships include L&C Carbon, a project partner, contractors for carbon inventory data collection and analysis, and third-party verifiers.  As a CARB project, the additionality and permanence of carbon removals is verified with the highest accuracy required under any program.

However, we are exploring verification and remeasurement of carbon stocks via remote sensing. Remote sensing has been used with success to quantify biomass of forestlands and has the potential to measure at least the change in standing carbon stocks with accuracy.  A remote sensing approach to monitoring would reduce the ongoing project cost.  In addition, such an approach implemented via a remote-sensing protocol for IFM could facilitate establishment of more forest carbon sequestration projects.      Part of remote sensing’s promise lies in combination with AI, which can be applied to identify carbon volumes of forests based on aerial photos.  This technology is still emerging and could have profound impacts on successful forest management.  ","The project itself does not offer a technological innovation, but data from the project could be used to train AI in remote sensing of carbon volume sequestered by forests. There is no protocol for remote/aerial measurement of carbon in IFM projects in North America. Verification and remeasurement is costly and resource intensive and may preclude smaller-scale forest owners from implementing carbon projects. Lowering these costs could increase participation in IFM and other carbon sequestration projects among smaller forest owners.","Deforestation is antithetical to our management philosophy. Previous landowners managed this landscape to maximize short-term harvest. We are instead optimizing for long-term forest health.  We are actively rehabilitating the forest, increasing carbon stocks, and improving environmental health for the surrounding area. Examples of changed forest practices are: (1) increasing the time between harvests (i.e. extending rotation age), which allows trees to sequester more carbon over their lifetime; (2) controlling overstocked stands through thinning; and (3) using silviculture to maximize long-term forest growth.     Certain management activities—the use of pickup trucks to inspect sites, for instance—do rely on fossil fuels.  However, our lower management intensity compared to prior ownership almost certainly reduces total greenhouse gas emissions.    Almost all the forestland Green Diamond owns in Oregon is open to the public.  As we improve forest health though improved management, we reduce the risk for catastrophic wildfire and smoke inhalation, while improving the quality of outdoor recreation available to the public on our lands.

Heirloom's technology is co-invented by the world's leading experts in direct air capture and carbon mineralization, including Dr. Jen Wilcox, Dr. Peter Kelemen, Heirloom's Cofounder and Head of Research Noah McQueen, and others.

Magnesium and calcium-based minerals are earth-abundant and naturally uptake carbon dioxide (CO2) as a part of the carbon cycle. Our technology works to accelerate and amplify the ways these minerals take up CO2 in a cyclical process to repeatedly capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere.

We start with a magnesium (MgCO3) or calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Under high temperature conditions (â‰¥ 350ÂºC for magnesium carbonate and â‰¥ 825ÂºC for calcium carbonate), the carbonates break down into CO2 and reactive oxides (calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO)). This process, called calcination, is commercially deployed across multiple industries, including cement and lime production. At optimal conditions, electric calcination can produce amorphous oxides that are highly reactive with CO2, even at atmospheric concentrations (roughly 400 parts per million CO2 by volume). Post-calcination, the material can be placed outdoors in contact with air and naturally reform carbonate materials. In nature, this carbonation happens over a number of years, but Heirloom's proprietary, low cost techniques accelerate the process to two weeks or less. Additionally, unlike other direct air capture technologies, we don't require forced air flow or large energy intensive fans so our energy use and OpEx are significantly lower. 
Once the oxides have sufficiently carbonated, they are collected and can be re-calcined. The carbon dioxide from the calcination is captured and stored either in geological reservoirs or by mineralization. The produced oxides can then be carbonated again, and the process can continue cyclically.

Heirloom is the project developer, technology provider, and plant operator for these projects, and works in conjunction with a downstream storage partner and upstream renewable energy producers. We are evaluating a number of different host sites in California and Illinois. Our first deployment will begin operations at ~1000 tons/year in late 2022 and scale to ~20k tons/year in 2024. Microsoft s CDR payments will be instrumental in funding the Capex and Opex for this first deployment. 
","Heirloom is the project developer, technology provider, and plant operator for our direct air capture technology. Our engineering, research, production and integration teams are responsible for our roadmap and deployment. We combine our expertise in CDR (described above) with extensive experience in industrial automation, technology deployment, and company scaling. Our CEO Shashank Samala (formerly co-founder and VP of Product at Tempo Automation) has raised over >$100M to deploy several electronics factories that now serve aerospace, medical, and other mission critical industries. He is joined by leadership from Tesla, Plenty, and Nuro who've all built automated factories before. Heirloom's DAC plants are closer in principle to an automated factory than they are to a chemical plant. Heirloom is majority owned by employees and company directors, and backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and others with deep experience in climate and industrial technology deployment. 

Heirloom will manage the capture process, but will work with third parties and government agencies to secure a host site, downstream CO2 storage, renewable energy, and engineering, procurement & construction. We are in the process of down selecting partners for each of these capabilities, with a short list for each. 

There are two options for the produced CO2: geologic storage and utilization. In the short term, Heirloom will likely pursue a combination of both geologic storage and utilization options. Specifically, utilization opportunities where the CO2 is sequestered durably goods such as concrete are particularly interesting. Confidentially, partnership discussions are ongoing with CarbonBuilt, Remora, and Solidia, as well as a number of ready mix concrete producers in California. In addition, we are in active conversations to access geological storage through planned Class VI wells in Southern California, Wyoming, Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois. In the long term, Heirloom s target is secure, geologic storage and both ex-situ and in-situ mineralization opportunities that store carbon for 1,000+ years. As an additional revenue source, we may end-of-life some net-negative mineralized carbonate.
","The ambient oxide looping process is a product of years of research by carbon mineralization expert Dr. Peter Kelemen at Columbia University. In early 2019, he and DAC expert Dr. Jen Wilcox began pursuing an idea that we could produce amorphous MgO from processing it at a high temperature and that the subsequent carbonation reaction should occur quickly at ambient conditions - with a rate mirroring that of brucite (Mg(OH)2). They began work with Greg Dipple, Phil Renforth, and Noah McQueen to perform a preliminary TEA. Dr Wilcox and Noah McQueen evaluated a number of different system designs, including fluidized beds, conveyor systems with forced airflow, and others. In the end, they became convinced that equal conversion could be achieved through ambient weathering, albeit over longer periods of time. The resulting passive carbonation design was promising, with costs competitive with or cheaper than most alternative systems, published in Nature (link). With the projected costs and system design in hand, an initial provisional patent application was filed. 

Peter then engaged with Kevin Tidwell at the Grantham Foundation and Shashank Samala, a serial entrepreneur with experience building industrial automation and interested to start a negative emissions company. A proposal was submitted to Grantham Environmental Trust in December, 2019 for the first iteration of rate experiments, which was funded at $500k. This covered basic research, including developing insight into the maximum theoretical carbonation rate of MgO and initial experiments to determine the kinetics of ambient carbonation and methods to accelerate carbonation. In March, 2020 Shashank Samala formally incorporated Heirloom in an effort to commercialize the technology. Heirloom has since raised a seed round from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Grantham, and others. We have also won research grants from ARPA-e and NSF, and grown our team to 15, including engineering and business leadership from Tesla, Plenty, and Nuro. We have graduated from lab to prototype scale in our Headquarters in San Francisco, CA, and are preparing for a commercial deployment to break ground in June of 2022.

This carbon removal would not happen without the development and deployment of this technology. 100% of the project is removal.
",No,No certification,,N/A,"The following analysis includes emissions directly from the process (Scope 1 Emissions), as well as those associated with mining the carbonate mineral, energy production, and subsequent sequestration (Scope 2 Emissions). The carbon accounting does not include embodied emissions associated with constructing the process (Scope 3 emissions) or CO2 leakage from storage reservoirs, if any, because the exact construction and embodied emissions are not yet known. Note that there is a substantial buffer provided in Gross Project Emissions and Emissions/Removal Ratio (accessible to Microsoft during due diligence) to account for this.

A representative image for the energy and material requirement for the process can be provided. The primary inputs to the process include energy, minerals (CaCO3 or MgCO3), and water. The primary outputs (some of which are recycled within the process) include CO2, water, some solid residues, and energy in the form of rejected heat that can be used to further decrease the energy requirements for the process. 

There are two big LCA considerations: mining carbonates and energy requirements. Carbonate mining typically involves an open-pit mining configuration. Compared to other forms of mining, there are no environmental impacts associated with acid mine drainage due to sulfur-based flotation and no environmentally harmful mine tailings. There are however, impacts associated with water runoff, dust production, and local ecosystem disruption. The impacts of open-pit mining depend greatly on the species being mined. Within the Heirloom process, the impacts are mitigated by repeatedly using the same carbonate material to capture CO2 from the air. In doing this, we reduce the amount of carbonate that must be extracted and minimize the aforementioned impacts on a per ton-CO2-removed basis.
 
The second main consideration is the energy requirements of the system. Within the process, we primarily require energy for calcining the initial carbonate material, as well as calcining the material for each individual cycle, condensing out produced water, and compressing the CO2. The calcination comes in the form of a thermal energy demand, which equates to 5.9 GJ/tCO2, excluding any opportunity for heat integration which could further reduce the process energy requirements. The condensation and compression total roughly 0.5 GJ/tCO2. This results in a total process energy near 6.4 GJ/tCO2, which is lower than other proposed methods for direct air capture. However, on account of the energy requirements for the system, we must take care in choosing the energy source that will meet these demands. Therefore we intend to partner an electric kiln to meet the thermal energy demands, with renewable electricity to provide these energy requirements. Many direct kiln configurations are suitable for this approach.  

While a complete LCA, including multiple environmental impact categories, has yet to be completed, a carbon balance can be provided for the overall system.

The results of this carbon balance show similar results to the preliminary carbon accounting included in the published techno-economic analysis of the process (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16510-3). In the published paper, the looping process uses an oxy-fired calciner, which requires a pure oxygen and natural gas feed to completely co-capture the water and CO2 produced from the combustion process. This minimizes the electricity requirements of the system, but builds a reliance on fossil energy that is not advantageous to the process. For thorough evaluation, we can also provide the results from this initial analysis.","The mass of CO2 removed from the air can be directly measured as a physical flow that enters geological storage. We will also partner with a Class VI well who would also need to have an EPA-approved site-specific monitoring, reporting and verification plan, as required under Subpart RR of the GHG Reporting Program. 
Heirloom will also undergo a complete internal LCA analysis with Microsoft as part of Due Diligence.",Yes,,"From a technical perspective, the greatest risks are two-fold: (1) Migrating a prototype-scale to a commercial scale passive air contactor at low cost, and (2) demonstrating the integrated carbonation-calcination system over repeated cycles. Financially, the greatest risk is attracting sufficient market demand to satisfy investor and lender requirements to quickly scale a commercial operation in an economic fashion. 

Passive air contactor: Here, the greatest challenge will be deploying the passive air contactor to facilitate contact between the air and metal oxides in a way that allows us to achieve observed or better CO2 uptake on the commercial scale. The transition from lab (kg/year) to prototype (tons/year) has shown no decrease in uptake rates, but because this process has not been validated at commercial scale there is inherent risk in achieving the desired uptake rate. There are 7 key passive air contactor efficiency milestones that need to be met in order to achieve our overall cost targets <$50/tCO2 longer term. 

Repeated cycling: The second risk involves demonstrating the integrated system on the commercial scale. While this is also of paramount importance to the process viability, the calcination process is used industrially to mass produce cementitious materials and, therefore, poses less of a risk than the passive air contactor design. That being said, there are still risks associated with the calcination process that need to be measured, understood, and optimized before achieving commercial scale. Initial experiments indicate limited sorbent degradation over repeated cycling, but because the carbonation cycle takes at least two weeks, validation of the estimated high end (~100 cycles) of possible cycles is not yet complete. 

Financing: The primary financial risk associated with bringing our innovation to market is the need to formalize sufficient long-term offtake contracts to cover debt service and operations for a commercial plant. This is a key value that companies like Microsoft can bring to our business.
",10000,10000,"We have not directly measured the durability of our carbon storage. Heirloom s process relies on a storage partnership downstream of the pure CO2 production. Mechanisms for geologic storage are well-developed and available in the scientific literature and include structural, capillary, solubility and mineral trapping of the CO2 in suitable geologic reservoirs. These estimates are used to formulate the range presented above. You can find the referenced ranges in Chapter Seven of the NASEM report on Negative emissions and reliable sequestration, as well as corroborated in Kelemen et al. (2019) and de Coninck and Benson (2014). An important siting aspect for this technology will be co-location with either (a) a CO2 sequestration location or (b) CO2 transportation infrastructure, including pipelines or railways. Additionally, the likelihood of leakage during geologic storage is modeled in Alcolde et al. (2018). The actual durability and risk of physical reversal will have to be evaluated on a project by project basis, depending on the injection partner selected. 

This storage could also be in the form of mineralization via partnerships with a company like CarbFix. These mineralization processes inject dissolved CO2 into suitable basins - basaltic basins in the case of CarbFix - where the dissolved CO2 mineralizes to become calcium carbonates. This process is outlined in the Matter et al. (2019)
","Post-injection monitoring and verification will be performed by the chosen storage entity, as defined by a formal partnership between Heirloom and the storage entity. Monitoring will include tracking the physical plume of CO2 in the subsurface via seismic imaging, pressure data from injection wells to monitor for pressure buildup and ensure caprock integrity, and employing methods to detect CO2 leakage, such as eddy-covariance towers or CO2 flux chambers. An example of monitoring and verification protocol for the Cranfield Project is available in Hovorka et al (2013). Other projects  monitoring protocols are also available in the literature, primarily for pilot projects.

In the event of reversals, the buyer will be alerted directly by Heirloom. 
","The primary risks associated with durability are physical (i.e. leakage from the geologic storage basin). The likelihood of leakage during geologic storage are modeled in Alcolde et al. (2018). Factors for CO2 leakage, as well as basin geology and CO2 trapping mechanisms, must be taken into consideration when siting geologic storage projects to mitigate the chance of re-releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. In the case that the storage mechanism involves mineralization, such as is the case with CarbFix, the risk of re-release is greatly reduced as the carbon is mineralized on the order of years.

We will partner with storage partners who satisfy the requirements of the CCS protocol of the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program, whose permanence requirements go beyond the federal requirements for both Class II and Class VI wells (the latter of which are required to qualify for 45Q tax credit). The Class VI permit as required under the Underground Injection Control ( UIC �) Program is created under the authority of Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA �) to protect public health from water contamination. In addition to a Class VI permit, LCFS requirements including site characterization, well construction, operating, testing, well plugging, and post injection requirements are all listed here. Site certification and CCS Project certification by the California Air Resources Board, as well as clear and strict injection, operating, crediting, post-injection and post-plume stabilization processes are required. In addition, our injection partner will undergo EPA-approved site specific monitoring, reporting and verification plan, as required under Subpart RR of the GHG Reporting program.","We consider any leakage a volume underperformance and can deliver an equal volume in a subsequent period. 
",N/A,N/A,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"In order to deploy our technology, Heirloom needs to sell offtake for our first 1,000 tons at $2,054 as well as long term offtake at progressively lower prices. 

Our ideal outcome for Microsoft would be twofold:
1) to purchase 750 tons of offtake from our first deployment at $2,054/ton. This represents the most catalytic offtake for Heirloom with the most substantial impact on per-ton cost reduction. This offtake would have a delivery window ending in 2024, depending on the final volume purchased. 

2) to negotiate an LOI or MOU for long term offtake up until 2030. We have no maximum annual volumes we would consider. The prices and volumes indicated above are projections intended to begin a conversation around potential long term offtake interest from Microsoft, and are not intended to be firm prices. There is uncertainty around both price and volume that will have to be navigated in close partnership with Microsoft. Our ideal terms would include a minimum annual commitment from Microsoft to provide a market signal to Heirloom and their investors, converting to a price/volume contract upon the operation date of Heirloom s first deployment.
",N/A,,,,,"- Climate resilience in the form of reduced atmospheric CO2 concentrations
- High quality jobs creation and economic development in historically disadvantaged communities, especially those affected by a transition from an Oil & Gas driven economy to a climate friendly economy. See: Kern County below
- Ecosystem protection in the form of reduced land use and limited extraction
- Accelerated decarbonization of cement through shared electric calcination + CCS technology development
- Accelerated deployment of renewable energy
","Heirloom's is building fundamentally climate resilient technology, providing one of the world's only mechanisms for removing excess CO2 in the atmosphere. Direct air capture will both limit the effects of ongoing hard-to-abate emissions and help reduce CO2 concentrations long after we have decarbonized our economy. Along the way, we will provide high paying jobs and economic growth to communities like Kern County who are especially affected by the transition from a fossil driven to a clean economy. Finally, we have the potential to help accelerate the deployment of renewable electricity ","Heirloom was founded on the belief that climate change will have a disproportionate impact on the world s most vulnerable, and that carbon removal has the potential to be a great equalizer of opportunity. Large scale deployment of Heirloom s technology will result in cleaner air, healthier communities, and most importantly a reduction of harm against disadvantaged peoples. 

While Heirloom s technology can be deployed anywhere with renewable energy, CO2 injection potential, and carbonate feedstocks, our commercial deployments are particularly well suited to declining oil, gas, and coal regions. In Kern County, CA, for instance, where we hope to deploy our first commercial operation, there is significant overlap between non-arable land, injection expertise, existing well bore infrastructure, and suitable geological formations. The area is seeing declines in oil and gas production while simultaneously feeling the impact of heavy droughts on their agricultural economy. This will only get worse as climate change progresses. Our technology provides an avenue to help revitalize Kern County, providing better access to high paying, climate friendly jobs, driving investment in renewable energy, education and re-skilling workers, and creating cleaner air in the process. 

Globally, direct air capture provides a unique opportunity for the world s heaviest emitters in the global north, and North America and Europe in particular, to bear the cost of removing excess legacy emissions. These excess emissions have and will continue to affect the world s most vulnerable, and have created repeated and durable inequities between the global north and south. Removing those emissions benefits communities globally and will have outsize positive impact in these historically disadvantaged communities. 

Heirloom is committed to engaging local communities affected by the deployment of our technology in all phases of planning, siting, and construction. We recognize the uncertainty and hesitance around geological sequestration, and our role in educating the public about the safety of our technology. We also recognize the truly global nature of climate change and carbon removal specifically, and prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion in both our own workplace and our partners. 
","Heirloom s sorbent, calcium carbonate or limestone, is an Earth-abundant mineral and, as such, is mined from the Earth. After water, it is the most abundant commodity on the planet as it is used in cement production. As of now, we will procure carbonates from industrial suppliers. As we scale, we may integrate our supply chain to have more control over both the negative externalities and CO2 emissions of the mining process, as well as the cost of the feedstock. Co-locating our facilities with available reservoirs for mineral feedstock and geologic storage will also cut down the number of CO2 emissions from mineral and CO2 transport. Carbonate mining typically involves an open-pit mining configuration. Compared to other forms of mining, there are no environmental impacts associated with acid mine drainage due to sulfur-based flotation and no environmentally harmful mine tailings. There are, however, impacts associated with water runoff, dust production, and local ecosystem disruption. The impacts of open-pit mining are provided here, but depend greatly on the species being mined. Within the Heirloom process, these impacts are mitigated by repeatedly using the same carbonate material to capture CO2 from the air. In doing this, we reduce the amount of carbonate that must be extracted and minimize the aforementioned impacts on a per ton-CO2-removed basis.

Iberdrola S.A.,Yes,"Reforestation of a land in Cortes de Pallas (Valencia, Spain).",Cortes de Pallas Reforestation,Forestry (removal only),,,Reforestation,"
The project will consist of the reforestation of 409 ha (~1000 acres) of land using a variety of species to restore the local ecosystem. The area is located in the surroundings of the Cortes de Palla¡s Reservoir (Valencia, Spain) owned by IBERDROLA, which was affected by a huge bushfire in 2012 that burnt more than 29 thousand hectares. 
Reforestation will include:
1. In forested areas, the classic introduction of forest species suitable for the season that will form an arboreal canopy in the future.
2. In scrub-covered areas, supplementation with autochthonous tree species that create a forest stratum.

The actions to be carried out can be summarized in a repopulation with different species that adapt to the environmental conditions of the area on which it is going to act, after analyzing the deep knowledge of different variables involved, such as abiotic factors - edaphic, climatic conditions, exposure, altitude, etc. - of each stand.

The project will be carried out by Iberdrola with the collaboration of the Spanish start-up, CO2 Revolution. CO2R has developed a new technique for planting its own-developed smart seeds with computer-driven drones, using big data technologies to best deploy the seeds. These smart seeds are formed by a biodegradable capsule that contains a pregerminated seed and all the elements that guarantee its future growth. This system increases by an 80% the chances for the seed to rooting. In addition, the drones used contain a 2,000 seed dispenser that can reforest up to 6 ha in just 20 minutes.
Around 220 thousand trees will be planted in the area covered by the project during the 3 years planned, starting in 2022 and an estimated lifetime of 40 years. The trees to be planted are already present in the ecosystem, mainly Pinus halepensis, Quercus ilex y Celtis australis. 
The whole project will remove 50 738 tons of CO2 by the end of the period (40 years).

IBERDROLA is determined to move forward with this project for the reasons mentioned above and the acquisition of carbon credits by Microsoft can be a great contribution to this initiative in the Spanish region.
","
IBERDROLA is the owner of the target land and the project leader. The original area provided by IBERDROLA, 1669,17 ha, has been broken down into 5 work layers:

1.	Area suitable for manual planting: 56,08 ha
2.	Area for planting using DRON with high viability: 13,26 ha
3.	Area for planting by DRON with medium viability: 339,90 ha
4.	Area already self-regenerated: 59,06 ha
5.	Unsuitable area due to rocks and slopes: 1.067,36 ha

IBERDROLA, as an electric utility, does not have experience in land reforestation. We have established a collaboration with the start-up CO2 Revolution, qualified as one of the 100 best startups in the world by the South Summit 2018, for providing services both to communities and organizations that need to carry out planting activities and to those institutions that have the purpose of offsetting their carbon footprint. They have developed a process that shortens the time to achieve an official certification of the carbon credits by the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge.","
According to the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and fully in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Iberdrola launched the Trees program in late 2020. Aligned with our biodiversity strategy and seeking to be a model of creating economic, social and environmental value in all of our areas of influence, this program aims to promote the plantation of 8 million trees by 2025 and 20 million by 2030.

This project is part of our Trees program. Among all the potential lands to be reforested, Iberdrola selected an area which was severely affected by a fire in June 2012 in Cortes de Palla¡s (Valencia, Spain).

Following our innovation spirit, Iberdrola established a collaboration agreement with the start-up CO2 Revolution to deploy smart seeds with drones in Spanish regions. They will help Iberdrola to make a complete analysis of the areas to be planted, the development and extensive use of the smart seeds and their plantation.

The project began this year with the selection and assessment of our the land plots. All these tasks are necessary to set everything ready to make this plan real with the launch of the plantation in fall-winter 2022.
Iberdrola is currently evaluating different options to fund the project. A collaboration with Microsoft for this project would be very powerful and useful to successfully develop it.

Indus Delta Capital,Yes,The world's largest mangrove forest restoration project,Delta Blue Carbon 1,Coastal blue carbon (removal only),,,,"The Delta Blue Carbon Project  “ Phase 1 (DBC-1) is an initiative to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation, maintain biodiversity and create improved livelihoods, well-being and employment for forest-dependent communities in the Project Zone .The Project Zone is an area of 350,000 ha of the Sindh Indus Delta Region in the Thatta and Sujawal districts of Sindh Province in south-eastern Pakistan. The delta is a vast complex of tidal river channels and creeks, low-lying islands, mangrove forests and inter-tidal areas. The delta s mangrove forests are unique in being the largest area of arid climate mangroves in the world.
A global ecoregion in WWF s The Global 200, the region holds great ecological significance, supporting unique animal and plant species. The Indus River is the main migration route of thousands of birds, which cross over the Himalayas. 
The ARR/RWE Project Area is of High Conservation Value. The project directly supports the livelihoods of 60 villages around the perimeter of the Project Area. These communities represent ca. 5,000 households and ca. 43,000 individuals. Over a number of decades, mangrove forests in the Indus Delta have experienced massive-scale deforestation and degradation due to a number of contributing factors. These include their use by the local communities as a source of fuelwood, fodder and open range grazing by livestock. The situation has been exacerbated by the reduced supply of fresh water and sediments into the delta area due to upstream activity. 
In response to the threats to the delta, the Government of Sindh conceived the Delta Blue Carbon  “ Phase-1 (DBC-1), a public-private partnership through its Forest and Wildlife Department and Indus Delta Capital Ltd, a climate and development focused private. The project was originally conceived as a REDD+ project activity. This CCB&VCS Project Description proposes the ARR/RWE project activity for validation separately. The AUWD project is anticipated to be added at a later stage. To date (by end of year 2020), an area of some 75,000 hectares has been restored with mangrove plantations. A total area of 224,997 ha will be planted during the project lifetime. All planting is done in partnership with local communities in the Project Zone. A ward and watch system is formalised through Mangrove Stewardship Agreements (MSAs) with various community groups, from which they derive further income. The primary method for the identification of stakeholders in DBC-1 was through participatory rural appraisals and comprehensive SBIA workshops.
The project s climate, community and biodiversity objectives include: upscaled mangrove reforestation, participatory planning and awareness raising, access to education, sustainable fisheries, access to safe drinking water and healthcare, improved protection and law enforcement, community-based business development and access to microfinance, sustainable energy development, training and capacity building of Sindh Forest Department, promotion of various gender development and income generating activities for women.
The project s climate benefits include the sequestration of and estimated 142,050,139 tCO2e over its lifetime of 60 years at an estimated average of 2,407,629 tCO2e annually.
","DBC-1 is developed and managed by the Government of Sindh and Indus Delta Capital Limited, who have entered into public-private partnership arrangements through a 60-year agreement, renewable up to 100 years for the protection, conservation and ecosystem restoration of mangrove wetlands in the Sindh Indus Delta area. By collaborating with the project-area communities and partner organisations, Forest Department of Government of Sindh and Indus Delta Capital Limited take full responsibility to manage, finance and implement project activities for the duration of the project. 
The teams of the Sindh Forest Department and Indus Delta Capital have developed complementary roles for the smooth design and implementation of DBC-1. They coordinate project implementation and operations with all relevant project stakeholders.

Investancia Paraguay S.A.,No,"Multi-impact VCS-CCB project with carbon removals, reforestation oil and bioprotein",Impact Reforestation in the Chaco Project,Forestry (removal only),,,Reforestation,"Investancia Paraguay S.A. (Investancia) is undertaking a Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)  “ Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards (CCBS) grouped reforestation project, known as the Impact Reforestation in the Chaco Project. The Project is planting pongamia (Pongamia pinnata) throughout the Chaco Region of Paraguay on areas that were cleared of native Chaco forests more than ten years prior to the projects  start date. 

Investancia is developing a business model to establish pongamia as a regional commodity in a region where agriculture, other than cattle-ranching, is extremely difficult to make work. The focus of Investancia s business is four-fold:
1)	Production of reforestation oil;
2)	Allowing farmers to maintain cattle on silvopastoral lands with improved pastures;
3)	Providing protein (i.e., feed) for cattle from the pongamia seedcake; and
4)	sequestering carbon dioxide in the pongamia trees (i.e., generate carbon offset credits).
To date, Investancia has established a nursery, explored the suitability of pongamia in the region, developed protocols, assessed various genetic strains of pongamia, and spoke with numerous local landowners about leasing land. The Impact Reforestation in the Chaco Project will sequester carbon dioxide and generate GHG emission removals in the planted Pongamia trees and in the soil following the reforestation of degraded pasture. Initially, the project anticipates planting approximately 2,500 hectares per year starting in year 3. Investancia anticipates scaling this level of effort to reach over 7,500 ha per year to achieve a total project area in the range of 120,000 ha.

Carbon financing is a vital part of making the project go ahead, as the revenues from Pongamia oil and protein are insufficient. CDR payments from Microsoft would help scale the project faster, and to incorporate more social programs for the local communties, i.e. Chaco Meds (see PDD for more). The activity of Pongamia reforestation without incentives from carbon offset credits is extremely unlikely due to both technological barriers and barriers due to prevailing practices. Investancia alone has been able to overcome these barriers by developing pongamia specifically for reforesting the Chaco region. Investancia has the technical knowhow to propagate pongamia and is the first of its kind in the region to establish pongamia forest. Investors in pongamia technology are interested in its multiple benefits including its ability to sequester carbon and generate carbon credits.
","Investancia is specifically focused on reforestation and Pongamia tree propagation activities, while sister comapany and carbon marketer Quadriz, is the designated entity to sell VCUs from the project activity. 

Community members are allowed and encouraged to effectively participate in project decision-making and implementation of the carbon projects. Several locals, including Fredy Montoya and Gabriela Via±ales, are part of the management team.
The Project is developing the capacity of community members to effectively and actively participate in project design, project implementation, and ongoing project management. This said, Investancia is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and has an experienced, local team of unrivalled R&D and propagation professionals, including some of the brightest, regional agroforestry talents. Investancia s capacity development includes:

 ¢	Several of the management positions are filled by locals from the Chaco Region;
 ¢	Half of the positions are filled by women and several of the management positions are filled by women;
 ¢	Several of the management positions are filled by younger staff; and 
 ¢	Local employees come from the neighboring communities, including several hires from the Ayoreo Indigenous community. 

Management Capacity:
The key technical skills required to successfully implement the Project, include:
 ¢	Stakeholder identification and community engagement;
 ¢	Legal analysis of landownership documentation;
 ¢	Government policy analysis; 
 ¢	Biodiversity assessment and monitoring;
 ¢	Carbon stock measurement and monitoring;
 ¢	Reforestation knowledge, including propagation techniques, site preparation, nursery management, etc.; 
 ¢	Project management; 
 ¢	Local knowledge and fluency in Spanish; and
 ¢	Sales of carbon offset credits to raise climate finance.
The Project s management team and advisors have both the expertise and prior experience with financing, designing, and implementing forest carbon projects.

Evidence	As Pongamia pinnata is largely new to Paraguay within the last 10 years, there are no documented pests in the region. Risks of pests and disease found in forests in the project region are mitigated by correct land preparation, nursery management when the seedlings are at their greatest risk, and close oversight and management once planted in the project area. 
Due to the geographic spread of the project instances and the fact there are no pest species that lead to full stand replacement currently in Paraguay, pest and disease in the project region are unlikely to affect more than 5% of the carbon stocks in the project area, hence the significance has been assessed as insignificant. 

While natural fires do occur in the region, they are primarily found in palm forest and forested areas with dense vegetation rather than in planted forest. While illegal and discouraged by forestry officials and forestry law, fire is occasionally used to clear land in grouped project region. Pongamia stands differ from native forests in that there is very little litter on the grounds to carry a wildfire and the low planting density ensures individual trees are widely spaced.
For the above reasons, the likelihood of a fire in the project area has been assessed to occur every 10 to less than 25 years. Should a fire occur, it is likely to have a minor effect and results in carbon stock loss of less than 25% due to the limited fuel availability and dispersed nature of the plantings. Both the planting design and stand management techniques are likely to limit the loss of carbon stocks.
Mitigation practices include all project plantings being surrounded by fire breaks. These breaks are maintained as part of the project activity. Further, project staff have a proven history of effectively eliminating fire from all planted areas to date.


Extreme Weather Risk
Evidence	Extreme weather risks affecting the project area include blowdown due to strong winds, rain induced flooding and erosion, and drought, 
A local forester who has worked in Paraguay s Chaco region for over ten years has confirmed that he does not know of any instances of blowdown affecting forests on a wide scale (Francisco Agustin Vergara, pers. comm.). As such the likelihood of an extreme wind event is thought to be in the range of once in every 100 years or more which corresponds to a score of zero risk.
While the risk of severe rain events includes flooding and erosion, flooding in not an issue as the site preparation in the project areas encourages efficient drainage. Further, as the land is largely flat, erosion is unlikely to be a problem as there is not enough slope to move the water quickly in the project area. While the return interval of gully erosion is not known, the effect is likely to be insignificant with less than 1% of the project area being affected in a way that leads to tree mortality.
Pongamia in general is very drought resistant  and has evolved to survive in very dry forested areas. While drought can be a significant risk during the seedling phase, the pongamia trees are not planted in the project area until the sapling phase once the trees are more resilient to adverse environmental conditions. Given that the geographic spread of the project stands and the knowledge that drought effects decrease with stand establishment and development, any drought is unlikely to lead to reduce carbon stocks by more than 5%. The drought return interval is every 10-25 years. The highest likelihood and greatest significance (that of drought) was used to assess the risk of extreme weather. 
A mitigation measure used to lessen the influence of drought has been built into the project design whereby the susceptibility of all trees planted to drought is reduced due to hardening of the trees prior to planting outside the nursery.

Details about reaching 0.5 gigatonne CDRS via TLUD stoves may be found in Section XII of the white paper  Climate Intervention with Biochar, � which is available at   www.woodgas.energy/resources .  
     **** The four major participants (Juntos NFP, Paul Anderson, Moulindu Banerjee and James Schoner) are presented in the next response, and the project history is detailed after that. 
     **** The activities and associated cash flows are briefly described as:
   1.  6000 existing TLUD stoves (already placed and in use at households for seven years) receive refurbishing ($36,000) and immediately produce 0.8 kg of biochar per day per household, being a total of 144 t of biochar (which is 360 t CO2e removal) per month (or 4320 t CO2e/yr)..  
   2.  Each household sells its production of biochar at an established price to our project's  designated charcoal collectors who work with our business Implementation Partner Moulindu Banerjee.  
   3.  The Implementation Partner oversees the collection, local storage, treatments/innoculations or charging (if any), and ultimate in-soil dispersal/deposition of the biochar.
   4.  .  The tonnes of biochar created from sustainable biomass fuel are being mixed with compost and manure for agricultural benefits with multi-century carbon dioxide removal and storage (CDRS).  [NOTE: The  S � on CDRS emphasizes that the removal also accomplishes long-term storage that is an improvement upon the relatively short carbon removal permanence of  nature-based forestry (AR) and soil organic carbon (SOM) which are major CDR technologies.] 
   5. Raw data, derived data, analyses, and visualizations (dashboards and reports) are available to independent, third-party evaluators who have been given reviewer access to CERCS CharTrac and the CERCS Registry, key apps in our digital MRV scheme.  Following their reviews, these evaluators issue reports to the project, the sponsors, the CDRS unit purchasers, and the public.
   6.  In the initial few years, these operations and digital MRV costs are expected to be high.  Contracted services with Bitmaxim Laboratories, the third-party entity implementing our digital MRV scheme via the CERCS web/mobile apps, are rather costly, but we have seen no other approach that is nearly as comprehensive (from process analysis, procedure development, in-field data capture, processing and visualization of raw and derived data, and final visualization) for ensuring the level of quality needed to establish and maximize full confidence and acceptance of our CDRS tonnage.  Included in our digital MRV scheme are sampling and laboratory testing of the biochar (not a trivial expense).   Note that the project owner is Juntos NFP, a registered USA nonprofit that is required to utilize any surplus funds for appropriate purposes that actually advance the objectives that are shared by all participants.  This includes allocating surplus funds for improvement projects and for services to the impoverished communities where the project s households are located. 
","	The overriding  governance of the  TLUD Stove Biochar in India"" project is in the hands of the Board of Directors (BoD) of Juntos Energy Solutions NFP (Juntos NFP).  President of the BoD is Robert Weldon, retired treasurer of the Illinois Farm Bureau.  All three directors are Rotarians and friends of the founder, Paul S. Anderson, PhD, who serves as the Executive Director without any vote on the BoD.   
***   Dr. Anderson is internationally known as Dr TLUD, one of the  pyroneers � of 21st Century micro-gasification.  Since his 2003 retirement (after 30 years of university teaching of geography and mapping science), he has worked full-time on micro-gasification issues, including fuels, pyrolysis techniques, char production, uses of heat (especially for cooking), and uses of char (especially for biochar into soils).   He has attended or conducted more than twenty week-long stove camps, biochar camps, and hands-on workshops on six continents.  Based on efforts since 2014, he developed in 2019  “ 2021 the RoCC kilns that enable biochar production in mid-scale quantities, for which he has a patent (pending).  From his base in Illinois (USA), he assists people and projects around the world.  His biosketch can be found on page 50 of his white paper  Climate Intervention with Biochar, � which is available at  www.woodgas.energy/resources .
	When this project moves forward with funding, the intention is to hire a Chief Operations Officer (COO) with substantial business management experience (and a corresponding salary to attract well-qualified applicants).  One exceptional and available candidate has already been contacted.  
	Responsible for the operational scene in West Bengal is Moulindu Banerjee, marketing consultant, business owner, and chief architect of the successful TLUD stoves project of atmosfair, the Germany-based carbon emission reduction trading nonprofit.  That project has 100,000 TLUD stoves in daily use in West Bengal.  He collaborates with Quality Enterprise, a local business that has been handling charcoal collection for over seven years. 
	For the extremely important work of MRV, James Schoner, director of Bitmaxim Laboratories (Champaign, IL), is contracted to provide laboratory testing services, quality procedures (QA/QC), and the mobile apps (CERCS CharTrac and the CERCS Registry) to implement our digital MRV scheme along with related features of the CERCS app ecosystem.
	Our team is actively engaged and progressively learning the additional steps of handling biochar for carbon sequestration.  Collectively, we have the right combination of experiences and skill sets needed to accomplish what this project is designed to do.  These experiences include substantial work with impoverished people in tradition-bound communities with needs that require care and  understanding.   We know the struggles of working with limited funding, and we are resourceful in finding the means to achieve success.  Furthermore, we have the vision that what we are accomplishing can (with adaptations) be beneficial to 500 million households worldwide where cooking is done with solid biomass fuels.  They are the poorest 40% of the World population, and virtually all of them can benefit from efficient, clean TLUD stoves which use only half of the same fuel that they currently use while also collectively removing for hundreds of years up to a half gigatonne of CO2e per year.

","     *** Dr. Anderson worked full-time from 2001 to 2015 to develop and establish the TLUD micro-gasifier stoves that make about 0.8 kg of biochar per day per household.  Two others (Thomas Reed and Paal Wendelbo, both deceased) are credited for their pioneering efforts in developing small stoves that conveniently pyrolyzed biomass and simultaneously burned woodgas in a Top-Lit UpDraft (TLUD) device.  Paul Anderson adopted, nurtured, researched, and advocated for the technology, creating the Champion stove design in 2005 when he also named the technology, becoming  Dr TLUD � and sharing his work and accumulated resources to all who desire to use this freely given technology.  The main archive (his website  www.drtlud.com ) contains the historical record that dates back to the mid-1980 s.  
     *** In 2007 - 2008, Indian manufacturer P. Mukundan of Chennai engineered the stainless-steel version of the Champion TLUD.  Until 2013 it had minimal success.  Then Moulindu Banerjee, a marketing expert in Kolkata, developed a system of product sales and support with funding from the carbon marketing NGO atmosfair of Germany.  A major document in 2016 (www.drtlud.com/deganga2016 ) explains the successful operation methodology with 11,000 households around the town of Deganga,  West Bengal.  That project has subsequently expanded to approximately 100,000 Champion TLUD stoves in West Bengal today.  However, the rules governing officially certified carbon credits  allow carbon emission reduction only, with no provision for carbon sequestration efforts with the biochar (e.g., irretrievably dispersing the char into soil)
     *** During 2018 to early 2020, Juntos NFP (with work by Anderson, Banerjee and Schoner) conducted its own stove project which was virtually identical to that of atmosfair  except 1) the location of the participating households was in a nearby but separate community named Hingalganj  and 2) the digital MRV scheme utilized  an early, less comprehensive version  of CharTrac (although it did include innovative features involving blockchain technology).   Five hundred (500) identical Champion TLUD stoves were in use in Hingalganj from October 2017 to January 2020.  We digitally documented the  creation  of 3000 carbon  offsets (emission reduction, not removal) that were not widely marketed.  The project closed (and the households kept the TLUD stoves) as a consequence of three cascading difficulties:  1) shortage of funds for expanding the number of stoves; 2) socio-political insecurities stemming from proximity to Bangladesh when the Indian government raised citizenship issues for Muslims; and 3) the beginning of COVID-19 disruptions.  The fruits of those efforts can be observed at the website  www.JuntosNFP.org   which has since been dormant.   Since then, Mr. Banerjee continued his work with atmosfair, Dr. Anderson invented the RoCC kilns for mid-size biochar production, and Mr. Schoner developed the CERCS app ecosystem (becoming the primary project at Bitmaxim Laboratories).
     *** Now in mid-2021, 6000 of the original 11,000 stoves in Deganga are available to produce biochar for carbon sequestration activities, leading to the proposed project.  In mid-2022 an additional 24,000 Champion TLUD stoves in the area will be producing biochar for carbon sequestration.  Growth beyond FY 2023 will be accomplished by annual reinvestment of proceeds generated by the project and expansion into additional areas.  
     *** The project history is also impacted by the awakening and realization around the world of the need for carbon dioxide removal with long-term storage, with the encouragement and actions of Microsoft for projects such as what is proposed.  The history of this project includes being in the right place at the  right time for all concerned.  This and related biochar projects for carbon dioxide removal and storage (CDRS) are ready at this crucial time to demonstrate how efforts with advanced pyrolytic technology led to a simple, efficient, and clean cookstove that can favorably impact the lives of the poorest billions on Earth while helping prevent climatic disaster on a planetary scale.

This is based on 7 years of earning such credits under Gold Standard and UNFCCC regulations and verifications.    But this proposal only refers to removals of CO2e.,Yes,Other (please specify),Woodgas Institute,N/A,,,No,"     All of the removal tonnes will have physically taken place and the documentation will  have been provided to independent verifiers (plural) in May / June 2022.   However, verification does not equal certification, which must comply with externally specified rules that are not yet finalized for CDRS via biochar.  We will work to have strong evidence that full certification is justified.
    We would like to have answered  Yes, to the highest level possible �.   However, when a new technology is being used, and because the specifics of  biochar as CDRS � itself are still questioned by some, the verification processes can have additional conditions/ expectations beyond our control.   Furthermore, nobody knows what expenses will be associated with the immature (evolving) standards and expected methods for verification.  Some such as the VERRA methods for biochar are currently being written, and the lack of experience of the independent evaluators with such verifications can cause delays.  Our advanced, digital MRV scheme includes independent, third-party reviewer access to all raw data from our field operations, derived data, analyses, and visualizations (dashboards and reports).   Full  transparency will be provided throughout all verification and certification processes.
     Further comments about certification follow:
     A.  Raw data, derived data, analyses, and visualizations (dashboards and reports) are available to independent, third-party evaluators who have been given reviewer access to CERCS CharTrac and the CERCS Registry, key apps in our digital MRV scheme.  Although TLUD cookstoves have been examined in laboratories and in some household situations, the focus was on emission, not the biochar.   One exception  are the results published in the 2009 document ""All biochars are not created equal...."" by McLaughlin, Anderson, Shields and Reed.  Basically, TLUD stoves produce good biochar.   Also of interest are relevant documents about biochar measurement and verification available from the IPCC, GS, VERRA, IBI, USBI, EBC, Puro.earth, and others.
     B.  Regarding Ex Post Verification, removal tonnes are pre-allocated and reserved in the CERCS Registry under Microsoft ownership.  As daily field operations yield sequestration data through CERCS CharTrac, that data is matched to unique reserved removal tonnes, fulfilling removal tonne reservations and triggering ex post verification processes.
","*** 1.  Burning:  Biochar could be burned after initial immutable digital records are created by CERCS CharTrac.   Our field operations personnel use the CERCS CharTrac mobile app to track our biochar from production to its placement into soil.   This includes scanning barcoded and/or QR coded container seals, recording location information (GPS coordinates), and submitting chain-of-custody (digital) signatures.  Before the biochar is placed into soil, we guard against its combustion by ensuring the biochar is not stored hot or dry or unprotected.  We may optionally inoculate the biochar, possibly mixing it with compost or manure, which further helps guard against combustion.  
*** 2.  Bureaucracy:   The previously mentioned rules and standards for verifications and conditions for final certifications can disrupt delivery of those final certifications.   Also, permissions from regulatory authorities for innovative work related to fire and  emissions  and biochar could introduce difficulties.   
*** 3.  Force majeure:   For example, COVID-19 could impact the people who are essential to this project and cause delays in the timetable.   Also, socio-political unrest at local or national levels could disrupt the plans.
",1000,500,"Apart from the risk of being burned, raw biochar can remain relatively intact, holding its carbon for thousands of years, basically like coal that stays in a coal mine.  But to re-fill a mine would be costly and without any co-benefits.  However, there are specific advantages (crop productivity gains and  proximity  “ low transport costs  “ to the  place of pyrolysis) to placing biochar in soils where it is exposed to physical-chemical forces and biological agents such as microbes and fungi.  And even in soil, biochar is very stable (recalcitrant to rapid decomposition) for well over five hundred years. We base our expected durability term on the  published (but not universally accepted nor consistent) findings of the IPCC, IBI, EBC and relevant scientific literature.  Physical reversals are discussed in the next response boxes.

","*** The final and necessary step for registering a carbon removal (carbon sequestration) unit in the CERCS Registry happens when CERCS CharTrac collects or is provided evidence and/or credible attestation of biochar being thinly dispersed into soils.  Beyond that, there are no existing scientific tests of permanence of specific deposition of solid carbon into soils, in large part because soil organic carbon (a component of soil organic matter) becomes indistinguishable from elemental carbon during test procedures which utilize high heat.  
*** As much as we would like to state that there will be monitoring of the biochar sequestration for 500 or 1000 years from now (being to either year 2521 or 3021), nobody can guarantee such monitoring.   A mere 250 years in the past (year 1771), Benjamin Franklin would not have been able to guarantee with confidence that even the United States Government (not yet formed then) or any existing business would be able to check on something guaranteed to exist to 2021. We will do our best efforts to comply with whatever arrangements are finalized.","There are two major threats of reversal:
**** 1)  Burning of the created biochar.  We mitigate against this by having a short time period and rigorous surveillance between supervised (and documented) production until the biochar is rendered to be unburnable.  [There is no specific verb for this in the English language, i.e., to  unburnableize �]  Immediately after our biochar is created and quantified, we guard against its combustion by ensuring that it is never stored hot or dry or unprotected.   In fact, the biochar is stored sufficiently damp so that it cannot burn without significant efforts for drying.    Additionally, we may optionally inoculate the biochar, possibly mixing it with compost or manure, further helping to guard against combustion.  
**** 2)  Biochar thinly dispersed into soil is unburnable.  But it can undergo very slow decomposition.  We estimate the half-life to be between 500 and 1000 years, well beyond the short timeframe for the World s currently needed carbon removal efforts.  We will discuss a discount rate of 50% for 500 years.
","The compensation would be through a project-level buffer pool to be negotiated.  Note that any loss of sequestered carbon (biochar) due to fire prior to the biochar being rendered  unburnable � poses no risk to Microsoft s investment, as our definition of sequestered carbon requires placement into soil or permanent substances such as asphalt before it can be validated or certified. ","All of the carbon credits in the buffer pool would come from this project.   All would be true carbon removal tonnes, and none from emission reduction (avoidance) tonnes.","Concerning the suggested half-life of 500 years (which would be a discount rate of 50% for 500 years), up to half of the CDRS units could be placed into a long-term holding folder in a registry-level buffer pool. ",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Thank you for asking for our  ideal outcome from this  proposal. �  We are utilizing the most promising modern advanced cookstove technology for the benefit of impoverished families that will at the same time help prevent the pending  climate disaster.  We are literally at the frontiers of applied science with appropriately simple low-cost technology. We would like to consider receiving a grant or a guaranteed loan or direct investment for providing appropriate clean cooking to impoverished people, instead of relying on estimating elevated prices of promised CDRS tonnes as our source of development capital.   We  would like to know how much advanced purchase funds of future years we can obtain for use in our initial year or two.  We are able to offer a multi-year contract with projections based on seven years of experience.  We heard Elizabeth Willmott speak at two very recent webinar panels about Microsoft interest in contracts.   Without advanced payments to cover the expenses of putting TLUD stoves into households, offtake contracts merely help us seek loans from doubting bankers or investments from risk-adverse wealthy skeptics with their financial objectives. ","The price per metric tonne of CO2e could go from US$200 down to US$100 as we gain experience and increase production. The selling of the physical biochar for soil-enhancing benefits is not included in these prices.  We only offer the sequestered, monitored and verified certificates of removal for carbon drawdown. 

",,,,,"	Biochar is well known for its water holding capacity, reduction of need for fertilizer, filtration of water, enhancement of soil, etc. 
	Our project with biochar-producing TLUD stoves yields the following co-benefits defined by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
	** SDG 1:  Poverty is reduced by financial saving of approximately 50% on fuel costs (or less fuel collection  time).  Also, the households receive cash payments every four weeks for their produced biochar.
	** SDG 2:  Less hunger via increased food production because the soils are improved, and the cooking is enhanced with better fire control.
	** SDG 3:  Better health as a result of cleaner household air and cleaner ambient air.
	** SDG 4 and 5:  Education can be indirectly benefited through improved gender equity when girls and women spend less time on time-consuming traditional inefficient cooking.
	** SDG 6:  Biochar can benefit water filtration and  septic systems before final sequestration into soils.
	** SDG 7:  Sustainable thermal energy via pyrolysis helps families meet their energy needs in modern clean-burning ways.  
	** SDG 8 and 9:  TLUD stove usage creates job opportunities for local people.
	** SDG 10 and 16:  Sales of CDRS units help transfer funds from the affluent to the impoverished, reducing inequalities while improving prospects for justice and peace.
	** SDG 11 and 12:  Sustainable cities can benefit from cleaner ambient air and provide responsible (non-fossil) fuel consumption as the TLUD stove programs expand.
	** SDG 13:  In addition to CDRS, there is reduced air pollution as climate action.
	** SDG 14:  Improvement of water quality in ponds and rivers can be assisted by the addition of biochar, (but that is not a focal  issue of this project).
	** SDG 15:  Strengthening soils improves life on land.
	** SDG 17:  The TLUD stove biochar project builds partnerships between small farmers and large corporations (and many in between) for accomplishing the goal of saving our planet.
","The efforts by many people to understand and document the cascading co-benefits of biochar production and use is a collective work in progress.   The multitude of benefits of biochar are currently grossly underestimated and even ignored.   Our project will contribute both measured results for some benefits and suggest methods of measurement for others.  This requires time that, when dealing with agriculture, is expressed as growing seasons for seeing measurable impacts.  Some social benefits require even more time.  Our sites and datasets will be open for others to participate in these evaluations.","*** Definition 1 :  If our definition of  �populations in and around the project area � is restricted to 50 or even 100 kilometers radius, the vast majority of that population is the same (not diverse because almost all are low-income rural Indians).   They have equality in that almost all are in relative poverty, and they lack diversity.
*** Definition 2:  If we define  populations in and around the project area � as including the global societies, then this project in India is focused on inclusion of very impoverished people who gain in equity by financially sharing in benefits from affluent societies and  thereby have enhanced diversity by including Indian farmers who would otherwise not be part of the needed global effort for resolving the climate issues.   
*** We prefer the second definition to describe our project as having diversity while enhancing equity and  inclusion. 
","We are alert to watch for and mitigate potential environmental and  social  harms,  but there are no serious issues seen thus far.  The total elimination of smoke from the TLUD stoves is an operational goal, but the current level of emissions is extremely low and much less than that of the current cooking with inefficient stoves.

Living Carbon PBC,Yes,Microsoft supports planting of photosynthesis-enhanced trees with improved carbon assimilation,Living Carbon Enhanced Tree Growth Pilot Project,Forestry (removal only),,,Reforestation,"It is estimated that from 2001 to 2020, global forest cover declined by nearly 10%, equivalent to 165Gt of COâ‚‚ emissions, presenting a significant carbon-cycle problem but tremendous conservation challenge and opportunity. Since 2019 Living Carbon has made enormous strides in genetics and breeding to deliver innovative carbon-capturing trees. Based on biomass data collected by Living Carbon, our photosynthesis-enhanced trees accumulate up to 150% more carbon per acre than wildtype trees. Now Living Carbon is moving into an implementation phase in which we are engaging small and medium-sized landowners throughout the United States with our enhanced carbon capture trees.

Living Carbon s photosynthetically enhanced poplars are already growing on our pilot planting project in Oregon. Over the next 12 months, we are expanding our operations to include projects with new landowners on more than 1,200 acres, including degraded mining land. Unlike projects that seek to avoid emissions from land-use conversion, Living Carbon has the expertise and products to work with landowners on reforestation projects to transform marginal lands, disturbed lands, and lands that are underperforming by planting trees that can capture significantly more atmospheric COâ‚‚ than control plants of the same species. We are working with landowners of our contracted Georgia sites to plant hybrid poplar on harvested sections where forest regeneration is stunted and landscape and terrain doesn't permit cost-effective replanting.

To clear the way for scaling up our operations, Living Carbon has worked with the USDA to confirm that our biotechnology and bioengineering methods are not considered regulated by the USDA. Living Carbon also received an award from ARPA-E for another related bioengineering project and was honored to be selected for a panel with DOE secretary Jennifer Granholm. 

Contracted carbon removal units to Microsoft will be purchased from Living Carbon and cover the cost of landowner leases and easements, nursery propagation, site prep, and planting costs of Living Carbon trees. 

Payments from Microsoft to Living Carbon will be allocated as follows: 
$50-75 per acre/yr (30 yr contract) to landowners for annual land easement / lease
$11-15 per acre/yr to LC for project management and monitoring.  
$645-700 per acre to LC in upfront costs for site preparation, seedlings and planting","Living Carbon is the developer and owner of this project. Living Carbon is governed as a Public Benefit Corporation. As listed in the company's charter, the company is obligated to pursue its public benefit of ""developing and implementing more efficient biological CO2 fixation, photosynthesis, and CO2 systems to address climate change and global food insecurity."" This duty to our mission and PBC governance ensure Living Carbon's incentives are aligned with corporate credit purchases to maximize sequestration and not the number of Living Carbon trees deployed. 

Living Carbon utilizes a land-lease model with landowners requiring a 30-year easement at minimum with the opportunity to renew at the end of the contract for another 20 years. Copies of our standard landowner contract can be provided at request. Living Carbon is responsible for the cost of the seedlings, labor, and materials for planting the seedlings (including pre-planting preparation, such as fertilization and weed control), and all expenses relating to Living Carbon's access to the land and data collection. Landowners are responsible for clearing the land as needed to be suitable for planting and must take commercially reasonable steps to manage the land and preserve the seedlings sustainably. In exchange, Living Carbon provides the landowner with an annual payment to lease the land of $50-75 per acre. Upon expiration of the contract, landowners have the exclusive right to harvest all timber from the seedlings growing on the land and retain the proceeds.

We will follow a path similar to other innovative nature-based solutions like Silivaterra/NCX and seek registry-level certification. Additionally, between field surveys, we are forecasting carbon sequestration via a forest growth simulation model (i.e., FVS) and tracking progress in response to finer-scale events using remote sensing monitoring in an empirical-statistical carbon model tied to USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis carbon storage estimates.",N/A,"Living Carbon is taking steps to obtain a third-party evaluation of our life-cycle assessment (LCA) emissions for our Georgia reforestation sites. While commercial afforestation has already been shown to provide robust mitigation of GHG s (Forster et al., 2021, Nature), with growth rate being the most important determinant regardless of harvesting, we seek to demonstrate the same with our photosynthetically enhanced trees on reforestation sites (and planned afforestation sites in the future). Furthermore, we seek to deepen our understanding and to minimize our CO2 emissions that arise through nursery propagation, site prep, planting, and removal (for our sites that will harvest).

The process for LCA accounting will be based on comprehensiveness and transparency of our operations on (and off) our contracted easements. Points A) through E) are addressed below.

A) The (emissions accounting) boundaries of our LCA will be constrained to management practices and treatments within our forest boundaries, but will also include primary CO2 emission sources from (1), our nursery propagation activities and (2), delivery of trees to project sites.
B) The boundaries were set by considering the predominant emissions sources and selecting them on the basis of consistency across our operations and for accuracy (certainty about their emissions). While other sources and indirect scopes of emissions could be accounted for, those emissions are very small and highly uncertain compared to the biomass accumulation rate of trees.
C) Outside of those emissions being considered in our LCA, no other sources are considered significant.
D) Other sources are not included because they are likely to be highly uncertain and small in magnitude relative to tree biomass accumulation.
E) The difference in CDR volume would be negligible if we were to include the unaccounted emissions sources.","Net negative tons will be verified in two steps.

One, a LCA performed by a third-party investigator will determine our emission deductions due to nursery propagation, planting, management, and removal. The first part, emissions from our nursery activities, will be accounted for using a process similar to Kendall et al., 2021 (Intnl Jnl of Life Cycle Assessment) , accounting for all aspects including on-site and direct energy use, soil emissions, fertilizers, and seed propagation. Secondly, emissions from our in-field activities at the planting site will be accounted for using tables and practices similar to those in followed to account for forest industry emissions in Global Perspectives on Sustainable Forest Management, Ch. 9, Bosner et al., 2012, Forestry and Life Cycle Assessment.

Two, to determine gross carbon sequestered, a licensed professional forester will perform an inventory assessment of each site prior to planting and every six to twelve years.

Last, in order to ensure that our plantings and projects are on track we employ in-house forest growth simulation modeling and remote sensing monitoring where we will use forest industry standard measurements and allometric equations (e.g., Wodall et al., 2011).",No,"The carbon removal units generated through Living Carbon's project forests will be issued and transferred after CO2 removal and third-party verification. To secure the pricing provided in this proposal in advance of delivery, we are proposing a forward purchase agreement that commits Living Carbon to deliver carbon credits to Microsoft in accordance with the methodology, volumes, and delivery timeline provided in the preceding and subsequent sections. All credits will be third-party verified ex-post before being transferred and issued to Microsoft.","Our easement contracts are all subject to environmental disturbance and market risks. The primary environmental risk to our trees is wildland fire, followed by windthrow damage from hurricanes and tornadoes, particularly for our sites in the Southeastern US (and planned sites throughout the Midwest).

The risk of wildfire is primarily a function of weather and forest management, for which we work with our landowner partners on silvicultural best-practices in order to mitigate fuel loads and fire risk.

The risk of windthrow on the other hand is primarily a function of location and height of the tree.  We recognize these risks may change over time and have set medium-range goals to build up our risk modeling capabilities in order to assess these threats probabilistically well before they occur and to adjust our planning and site selection accordingly.
",30,30,"Our Durability Term was determined based on the land-usage from our contracted landowners lands, which are timberlands that are harvested on about a 30 to 40 year rotation.

Determination of risk in physical reversal of carbon storage is not fully complete. Some disturbance dynamics have already been accounted for in our projections of CRU volumes, which were determined quantitatively through forest growth simulation modeling, using FVS (Forest Vegetation Simulator). However, these simulations need to be re-run for more explicit wildfire risk modeling with FVS using fire and fuels extensions to the base model. This will allow us to assess the impacts and risks of fire based on information about fuel loadings. Our fire and disturbance data will come from another Forest Service product, FSVeg (Field Sampled Vegetation).","In addition to modeling for risk of reversal we will be monitoring for physical reversals, which will happen in three ways.

One, across our project sites we do weekly monitoring of changes in canopy greenness by land surface phenology change detection, using the USDA Forest Service s Forest Change Assessment Viewer (https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/tool/forwarn). This level of monitoring captures the early signs of drought, defoliation, and destructive frosts relative to prior baselines. It can also be used for detection of major disturbances including wildfire and windthrow events.

Two, subsequent to land surface phenology alerts, more detailed inspections of canopy structure are conducted using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1. We use custom algorithms to build multi-temporal RGB composites of canopy change that can pinpoint changes in canopy structure, for example caused by damaging winds.

Three, in some cases site visits by our forest manager may be necessary to confirm remote sensing analysis. Subsequently inventory assessment by a licensed professional forester may be necessary in order to verify the volume of tree biomass lost.

All of the above analysis steps will be combined and reported to the buyer, along with our compensation options.","The primary risks for reversal in our projects are 1) wildland fire and 2) windthrow, which both could cause catastrophic loss of sequestered carbon. On any forest stand, fire (and to an extent windthrow) can be mitigated by selective thinning of the stand after the first six years. Prior to planting we model risk and yield quantitatively using an ensemble approach of scenario simulations run using the Forest Vegetation Simulator. Each site is different, whether due to species composition, geography, or history, and scenario-modeling helps us quantify the specific risks for each forest stand and adjust management accordingly.
","If Living Carbon is unable to meet its contractual obligations, Living Carbon will make up for the missing offsets by delivering offsets from other projects at the same price. If Living Carbon incurs an offset shortfall across other carbon projects and cannot provide the CDR tons, Living Carbon will provide the higher of refund at the cost plus interest rate of 2% or an agreed upon rate with Microsoft. Living Carbon recognizes the emerging and evolving nature of carbon markets and works with carbon purchasers such as Microsoft to ensure that risk is assessed and mitigated to both parties' satisfaction.","Additionally, we have pending sites in Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Iowa, West Virginia, Ohio, Minnesota, and the Mississippi alluvial valley representing a diversity of land-use types, including mining reclamation sites that have different reversal risks and similar removal percentages. In the case where Living Carbon fails to deliver the contracted CDR tons, removal from these projects may be used as a substitute.",20% of credits produced for this project in our even aged stands are held in a buffer pool.,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar)," We aim to sign a forward delivery contract for future CDR tons removed. Living Carbon commits to deliver CDR tons at a predefined time and price and Microsoft makes a multi-year commitment to purchase these tons. Living Carbon's minimum multi-year commitment would be a ten-year commitment of offtake of CDR tons generated by the project. The maximum tenure of offtake considered is 30 years. Given the biological nature of our project and existing land easements of 30 years with our planting partners, we would not need an additional timeline to begin delivery for an offtake agreement. ",We are providing price/ton volume discounts (see Q22) based on the number of credits committed to in the forward contract. No additional delivery terms apply for longer or shorter deal tenure. Living Carbon would continue to monitor and verify the CDR tons ex-post ensuring contractual CDR tons are delivered.,"Carbon removal on our sites will be inventoried by a certified forester that will perform surveys every six to twelve years.

Additionally, we are also pursuing remote sensing-based inventory estimation methods through third-party companies, as well as exploring our own in-house expertise.  Our in-house approach would begin with establishing an historical baseline based on each site using land surface phenology (e.g., NDVI) combined with USDA Forest Service FIA carbon storage data in a statistical empirical modeling approach. We plan to compare and analyze results against FVS modeled estimates and our field inventories.",486,3.79,See additional info,"Living Carbon has identified alignment between the co-benefits of our enhanced carbon capture projects and the UN Sustainable Development Goals here:
1.5 ""By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters""
Living Carbon's seedlings have second-order effects of drought resistance and resilience to climate-related weather events. We provide our seedlings at no cost allows landowners to allocate more resources to labor and individuals in rural Southeastern United States to participate in the green economy.
11.3 ""By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries. Indicator: Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate."" 
12.2 ""By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources""
Living Carbon's goal is to improve the land efficiency of terrestrial carbon capture through enhanced photosynthesis and other bioengineering traits by increasing carbon capture per acre. This reduces the pressure on and trade-off between agricultural land needed to feed our growing population and the need to expand and improve forests.   
13. ""Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts*
Living Carbon's goal of improving carbon capture per acre by >200% using advanced biotechnology allows explicitly for companies to decarbonize their supply chain without threatening food security. By incorporating Living Carbon's photosynthesis-enhanced seedlings or co-developing a photosynthesis-enhanced product in a way that does not threaten food production or supply, companies can reduce their carbon footprint while being more efficient with their land use. ","Sustainable management, land consumption and ecosystem protection are prime benefits of Living Carbon's enhanced carbon capture solutions. While we aren't tracking this formally, we are internally tracking our land-use types, and stand structures for monitoring purposes through remote sensing and GIS. 

We plan to track the above UN SDG targets internally and to record them in our web blog. They will also be posted on Clemson University Science Outreach Center's program. Posts would feature our scientists presenting LC's reforestation and remediation projects as examples of how STEM technology can confront global problems like climate change as well as community problems, including loss of forest and degraded soil.

Living Carbon planting projects will contribute at least $720,000 to the local economy of our project areas. By covering the cost of the planting, site preparation, and nursery propagation of our seedlings, Living Carbon advances economic equity in areas where 24-30% of the population in our project areas live below the federal poverty line. We employ local contractors, planting crews, and foresters. In addition, Georgia is one of the states in the US most severely impacted by climate change, with expected impacts including ""more severe floods and drought"" and higher water levels ""eroding beaches, submerging lowlands, and exacerbating flooding. (US EPA 2016). Many other engineering-focused CDR solutions conduct R & D in large coastal cities and do not have boots on the ground in local communities disproportionately impacted by climate change. Living Carbon is building its forestry team in Georgia and has an R&D lab in Charleston, South Carolina. We employ 10 full-time employees in these regions. We also believe communities disproportionately impacted by climate change need to be a significant part of the solution space. While we are limited by inventory, we plan to allocate seedlings as part of the project and future projects to landowners from underrepresented backgrounds whose communities are disproportionately impacted by climate change. We specifically focus on landowners who would not have been able to plant the trees and develop carbon stocks on their land without the financial support of Living Carbon's project.","The forestry industry can bring unintended negative impacts, including noise pollution, air pollution, and accelerated soil erosion. Living Carbon works with a niche market of landowners that are in need of forest cover solutions that both capture carbon at an accelerated rate and can grow on marginal lands. Consequently, we are able to provide them solutions that allow them to replant on previously harvested bottomlands that are idle (not appreciably regenerating naturally). This provides the landowner with a win-win solution that captures a new revenue stream for them and allows them to participate in a system of sustainable management for their land.

By keeping' forest in forest' the negative consequences of soil erosion and air pollution are mitigated by our trees.  Furthermore, by establishing long term easements that can continue to bring in revenue streams beyond 30 years, many landowners may choose not to harvest the trees and to continue to collect carbon credits through its most profitable years as a maturing forest. These decisions incentivize our landowners toward decisions that are smart for them financially and smart for their local communities and environment.",,,,,,
"NativeEnergy, a Public Benefit Corporation",Yes,The world's first large-scale grasslands soil carbon project,Northern Kenya Grasslands Carbon Project,Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"The Northern Kenya Grasslands Carbon Project aims to remove and store 50 million tons of CO2 over 30 years by implementing sustainable grazing management over nearly 2 million hectares of savannas and grasslands. Active, planned grazing and livestock movements across 14 conservancies will incentivize more sustainable grazing practices. Rapid movement allows the recovery of perennial grasses, increasing carbon inputs, retention of carbon as lignin and cellulose, and belowground carbon production - all of which drawdown greenhouse gases from the atmosphere into soil carbon.

The project is validated to the VCS using the  VM0032 Methodology  and certified to the Triple Gold Level under the CCBA standards.

The project grew out of work in the early 2010s in Tanzania that showed improving livestock grazing management could increase the storage of carbon in the soil. NRT facilitated a pilot project in 2008 in Westgate conservancy on improving rangeland management.

Major project participants: Northern Rangelands Trust, the 14 conservancies, Native, Soils for the Future, and The Nature Conservancy. Companies and organizations supporting the project have not yet publicly announced their purchase of credits from the project.

The conservancies are set up to receive approximately 60% of total sales revenue in the first three years, to increase to at least 69% over the lifetime of the project. The conservancies split the net project revenue into two parts: 40% goes towards supporting conservancy operational costs and rangeland program costs, and 60% to social development projects chosen by the communities. Funding from project supporters also helps cover the costs of verification, issuance, ecological monitoring, reporting, community engagement, and the required administration processes. Reserves will be funded to mitigate risks to project operations, conflict resolution, government taxation, NRT grasslands program more broadly, and carbon asset protection, monitoring and verification.","Governance structure:
Project activities are governed at conservancy level by conservancy grazing committees. These committees comprise 10-14 individuals who represent each of the zones / villages within a conservancy, ensuring every community member s voice is heard. The committees meet quarterly and discuss and agree the rotational grazing plans that form the basis of the project activities.
 
The committees are coordinated and managed by the Conservancy Manager and the Rangeland Coordinator. The committees are either a sub-committee of the Conservancy Board or a standalone committee in their own right (depends on each Conservancy).
            
The Conservancy Manager and their Rangeland Coordinator are answerable to the Conservancy Board, each member of which is elected on a rolling 3 year basis. The Chairperson of the Board represents that Conservancy on the Council of Elders, which is NRT s primary governing body.
            
NRT has developed the carbon program on behalf of conservancies in partnership with TNC, Soils for the Future and Native, a Public Benefit Corporation. 

Organizations involved in project design and implementation, and respective roles and responsibilities: 
The Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), which administers the project, supporting both its activities on the ground and the reporting needed for ongoing verification and for credits to continue to be issued.

The conservancies: Il N gwesi, Meibae, Namunyak, Westgate, Kalama, Sera, Ol Donyiro, Nasuluu, Nakuprat-Gotu, Lekurruki, Leparua, Biliquo Bulesa, Naibunga and Melako. The conservancies are responsible for carrying out project activities, and have authorized NRT to sell carbon credits resulting from the project activities on their behalf. 
 
Native: takes the lead in the validation and verification of the carbon with VCS, supports NRT to optimize project success and impact, and leads on the sale and marketing of the carbon credits to ensure maximum value and revenue to the project.

Soils for the Future: provides technical support to monitor the project s implementation by the communities involved, as well as soil sampling, modeling, and biodiversity and vegetation surveys, and ecological impact guidance.

The Nature Conservancy: helped develop the project methodology and provided start-up investment to support the protocol development, baseline data collection, and other project costs. TNC has been involved in on-going project management conversations and contributed some technical support, and supports credit sales.

Aster Global Environmental Solutions: VCS and CCB project validator and verifier.

The administration of the project is implemented by NRT. NRT has a Carbon Lead and a dedicated Carbon Project Officer. The Carbon Lead works at a high level alongside project partners Native and The Nature Conservancy to optimize the project success in implementation and reporting, in sales revenue maximization and program distribution, and long term program strategy.

The Carbon Project Officer works directly with the rangeland coordinators and conservancy managers who oversee the implementation of the project at conservancy level. The Carbon Project Officer is responsible for gathering all the project monitoring documentation, such as monthly grazing reports from each conservancy that are required by the carbon standard and necessary to measure project success. The Carbon Project Officer works with the NRT Rangeland Team to offer training to the rangeland coordinators and grazing committees on these aspects and offers ongoing mentorship to them.
 
The Carbon Lead works alongside the Project Officer to develop informed work plans and budgets for the implementation of the project and these are subsequently approved by NRTs Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer. The Carbon Lead integrates the project monitoring success information from the carbon project into the quarterly and annual work plans with the Carbon Project Officer to ensure ongoing best practices in project operations.

The project documentation (i.e. grazing reports, stakeholder meeting documentation, social impact reports) is provided to Native for analysis and compilation into VCS/CCB reporting documentation.  Native engages the VVB for each verification and is responsible for verifying and issuing the VCUs.","The project has been in development since 2009. In 2010, NRT and Grevy Zebra Trust successfully piloted Holistic Rangeland Management in the West Gate and Kalama conservancies. NRT and TNC partnered with Soils for the Future to demonstrate that better grazing management resulted in higher carbon storage in the soil. 
In 2012, the year the project formally kicked off, NRT scaled up its rangeland activities and expanded the carbon project to include 14 NRT-affiliated community conservancies in Samburu, Isiolo, Laikpia and Marsabit counties. 
In 2017, the 14 conservancies involved in the project gave NRT permission to sell the carbon credits generated by the project on their behalf and Native engaged in funding and assisting in the VCS/CCB validation and verification process with Soils for the Future. 
In 2018, conservancies signed consent and waiver forms. In 2019, public notices were posted at the conservancies' headquarters and chiefs' offices. In 2020, Verra certified the project as meeting the VCS Standard requirements under methodology VM0032. The project also received Triple Gold Status from the CCBA. In 2021, a total of 3.2 million verified and validated carbon credits became available for purchase.

It is solely a carbon removal project.,Yes,"Verra (VCS),Other (please specify)",CCBA,VCS #1468,,,Yes,,"Overgrazing:
The degradation of the Northern Kenya grasslands region is caused by overgrazing. The region s grasses are a primary resource for the livelihoods of a very diverse population of people and animals from private ranches to pastoralist herders to wild herbivores. Without coordinated and informed grazing strategies implemented across the landscape, the perennial grasses are grazed too long with insufficient time to regrow and regenerate. 
 
The region now has established conservancies to create stronger governance structures in regions with communal land use. The project supports Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) in its work with these conservancies to create regional grazing plans that allow grasses shorter graze periods, sufficient rest, and agreements among conservancies to reduce conflicts over the limited grass resources. 
 
Drought:
Droughts are becoming more frequent and severe in the region, particularly since the project start date. For example, an extreme drought in 2017 (not included in this issuance) drew international attention to violent conflict in the region. 
 
A component of the grazing plan strategies is to build grassbanks to be used for delayed or infrequent rains. These can be used for regional grazers during times of stress. Additionally, a pillar of NRT s work with conservancies is conflict mitigation and dispute resolution to ensure compliance with the grazing strategies.
 
Droughts are expected to continue to be a threat to the region so heavily dependent on grass. Going forward, project revenues will create an insurance mechanism for further supporting efforts to mitigate the effects of extreme drought.

Reversal:
While it is widely acknowledged reversal risks for soil carbon are real, we are taking necessary action to mitigate this through monitoring and evaluation of grazing practices and ongoing engagement with the conservancies involved. This project also carries far fewer risks of a reversal through an event like a forest being cut down or lost through fire. For the sequestered carbon in the soil across the 14 conservancies to be released back to the atmosphere would likely need multiple years of tilling or extensive over-grazing. While the latter does happen, the project is designed to identify it quickly and mitigate it before it has a significant impact. 

Though arable agriculture does occur near the conservancies, it is not practiced at scale within the conservancies. The expected financial and productivity benefits for the conservancies resulting from implementing the new grazing methods are projected to secure and motivate the conservancies and communities to continue to protect their rangelands from degradation and overgrazing. The project activity will create more forage and make the rangelands more resilient to drought. Seeing those benefits over time is already resulting in an appreciation of the benefits of the project activity's implementing grazing practices with pastoralists.",200,30,"The project activity of managed rotational grazing has already demonstrated benefits to the livelihoods of the community members participating in the project. The pastoralists have seen their animals are in better condition when they are rotated across the landscape and they have observed the gradual improvement in vegetation conditions even during the dry season. Continued managed rotational grazing, coordinated with neighboring conservancies, is expected to continue to improve animal condition, increase perennial grasses and forage available to grazing animals, and thus increase the productive capacity of the land. Our validated soil carbon model suggests such improvements, on average, could continue for the next 200 years. Thus economic incentives favor continued sustainable grazing practices beyond the end of the project monitoring period, providing substantial durability to soil carbon removals that occur during the project lifetime. 

Additionally, soil carbon reversals on rangelands are slow, as even droughts or a year of overgrazing simply prevents one year of carbon inputs. Substantial reversals require multiple years of return to poor grazing practices, which are unlikely given the economic incentives for continuing to use sustainable practices. The established soil carbon pool is under extremely little threat of catastrophic or immediate loss, as fires and droughts do not directly affect the pool. Conversion of grassland to crop agriculture is also extremely unlikely due to the poor sandy soils found in the project area and the low average and highly unpredictable rainfall in the region. For these reasons, the greenhouse gas removals to soil carbon in this project are extremely durable compared to woody plant carbon, which is always subject to catastrophic fire, unplanned deforestation, or logging.

Issued VERs: 3.2 million from years 2013-2016
Actual estimated tCO2e removed: 6 million

Conservative assumptions made on VER issuance
16% N-P risk buffer: 611,539 tco2e
Uncertainty discount: (No total project discount for uncertainty was calculated as it was less than 30%)
Leakage and Encroachment Estimate conservatism: Leakage in VM0032 is penalized by direct subtraction of estimated removals according to the portion of total animal-days project livestock occurred OFF the project area.
Annual modelled VER crediting rate: Per the VM0032 methodology, annual modelled soil carbon accruals were estimated averaging annual rates over the time it takes to reach soil carbon equilibrium with the improved practices. The Time to Equilibrium is over 150 years, but the rate of soil carbon accrual is likely to be much higher in the first 50 years of project implementation. Given the annual modeled accrual rate was averaged over 150 years as the denominator, the annual accrual rate used for crediting was 60% lower on average than the model actually predicted. 

The increases in soil carbon predicted by the validated SNAP soil carbon model and the method of calculation of increases in soil carbon required by the VM0032 methodology is based on assuming a constant increase in SOC from the baseline SOC to 95% of the model-predicted equilibrium SOC, averaged over the time required to reach 95% of the model-predicted equilibrium SOC. Over the first 50 years of project activity, the VM0032 calculation method underestimates likely actual SOC removals by 60%. Therefore the project's verified, issued credits are highly conservative.

Furthermore, we are claiming credits only for carbon stored to a depth of 20 cm; it is highly likely that carbon is being stored in deeper soil depths as a result of project activities, but we are not claiming removals for increases in deeper soil carbon. ","During the durability guarantee term, the project is monitored through multiple monitoring strategies including monthly grazing records from all participating conservancies to track livestock movements and numbers, satellite imagery analysis to assess success of implementation of project activity annually, and soil organic carbon measurement every 5-10 years. In the case of any reversal, credits are replaced with VCS Non-permanence risk buffer. In the case of intentional reversals, the project activity continues and monitoring continues until carbon sequestration rebounds and credits replaced. The project could then begin to produce issuable credits again. 

In the case of a reversal during the durability guarantee term, the buyer would be notified immediately and credits replaced using the VCS AFOLU Non-Permance risk buffer pool credits. ","The primary risk to reversal for this soil carbon project is overgrazing due to drought and the conflict that is precipitated by limited grazing resources across the landscape. The rangelands of northern Kenya sustain many migratory grazers. The project activity provides guidance on best grazing practices to mitigate overgrazing and facilitates coordination among multiple disparate groups of grazers including different pastoralist tribes, wildlife, and private cattle ranchers. 

The risk of reversal for soil carbon accruals is calculated using Verra s Non-Permanence Risk Assessment tool. This tool rates internal, external, and natural risks to determine the percentage of credits to be allocated to Verra s buffer pool (see above). For the first monitoring period, this buffer claimed 16% (approximately 600,000) of project credits. Unlike many forest-based projects, where forests can burn or be unexpectedly logged due to a breakdown in local land governance, there is little chance of catastrophic reversals in soil carbon from an unexpected event, such as a severe drought or locust plague. Reversals would instead be incremental. If soil sampling reveals the model underpredicted credited soil carbon accruals, the non-permanence risk buffer would repay these credits to buyers and future years of project activity would replenish the buffer.","The VCS AFOLU buffer replaces credits for buyers for intentional or unintentional reversals. Drought is the primary risk, which is an unintentional reversal.","The buffer pool is intermixed with credits from all Verra AFOLU projects. Each project is required to conduct the Non-Permanence Risk Assessment, which is validated and verified by the third party Validation and Verification Bodies approved by Verra. This project contributed 16% of otherwise issuable credits into the buffer pool, based on it's Non-Permanence Risk score.","A percentage of the carbon credits are set aside by Verra as a non-permanence insurance buffer against reversals of credits in the future. For the first monitoring period, this buffer claimed 16% of project credits (approximately 600,000), a threshold set by Verra over which the project has no control. The credits going into Verra s non-permanence buffer can be used for any of Verra AFOLU projects that may have reversals and will not be reallocated to this project if no reversals are needed. They contribute permanently to mitigating the reversal risk of all Verra AFOLU projects.",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Our ideal outcome is a collaboration with Microsoft to structure a contract that meets its goals and that achieves the projects outcomes and impact. We are open to any volume, tenure and timeline Microsoft proposes.","Our delivery terms are the same as above, though we are open to adjustments that may better suit Microsoft's requirements. Periodic pricing adjustments are to be expected over the lifetime of the project to deliver on project outcomes and impacts.","Carbon removal/sequestration is monitored through multiple strategies throughout the project lifetime. Baseline soil sampling was conducted in each of the 13 active conservancies in the project. Each conservancy was treated as a stratum and between 6 and 32 soil samples were collected from each conservancy between 2012 and 2016. Soil samples were analyzed in a Nairobi soils lab to determine soil organic carbon stocks to 20 cm dept (223 total samples). Within each conservancy, samples were such that the full range of expected varation in soil organic carbon stocks was sampled to test the SNAP carbon model, which is used to model carbon accruals for interim crediting between sampling events. The soil sampling will be conducted every 5-10 years to true-up the model and adjust crediting rate going forward. The second soil sampling event is happening in 2021.

Monthly grazing reports are provided to calculate leakage of project animals off project area and encroachment of animals from off-project area. These data are used to calculate leakage discounts and project methane emissions to be deducted from modeled carbon removals. 

Lastly, a remote sensing analysis monitors the project area. Each year, it calculates the proportion of that area where the project s activities were successful. The impact of grazing on vegetation can be detected with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which analyses satellite photos of the Earth s surface to calculate plant health. Healthy plants absorb and reflect light differently from ones that are struggling, or indeed from underlying soil. The project uses a model that detects livestock impacts on plant productivity and can separate them from climate impacts on plant productivity. For a given year, the total area of each conservancy that was grazed once or less is credited at that conservancy s modelled accrual rate (see section above). The area that was grazed twice or more is not credited at all.The remote sensing tool is built on an empirical relationship between the rainfall-corrected annual change in NDVI (dNDVI) and the number of times a location was grazed in that year, based on over 40 points of comparison of dNDVI and the pattern of seasonal grazing impacts. This relationship yields a threshold dNDVI, above which more than one grazing event occurred. This threshold is then used to classify the landscape as to whether successful implementation occurred.",1993078,Average accross strata: 0.81 tCO2e/ha/yr; Min 0.64 tCO2e/ha/yr; Max 1.14 tCO2e/ha/yr,,"The project is validated and verified to the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) from Verra.

Please refer to the validated project description for further detail.","There are numerous climate, community, and biodiversity co-benefits associated with this project. These and other co-benefits are measured, monitored and reported via the requirements and audits set forth by Verra and CCB and also NRT. Project co-benefits are measured through soil sampling, regular surveys on household income, sense of security, employment, and access to milk and water, number of grazing-related conflicts, the carbon revenue to conservancies, NRT s Wildlife-Conservancy Managed Monitoring System, biodiversity surveys, and more.","Social inclusivity, gender mainstreaming and indigenous people are central to the socio-economic dynamics of the northern Kenya landscape. Within the project area itself, there are no less than six different ethnic groups (Samburu, Laikipiak Maasai, Turkana, Somali, Borana and Rendille) and the work NRT does everyday in this landscape seeks to include and improve the lives of vulnerable and marginalized groups. 

Further, NRT has an active three-year gender action plan (2019-2021) which seeks to provide a roadmap for how NRT and its member community conservancies can support indigenous communities to spearhead gender equality and social inclusivity through conservation of natural resources. 

In 2020 alone, 20 gender and social inclusivity forums were conducted in six different counties, including all those involved in the project (Marsabit, Isiolo, Laikipia and Samburu). 908 people participated, 492 women and 416 men. Alongside this, reports from conservancy managers indicate that gender mainstreaming is now an agenda item in its own right at many conservancy board meetings, exchange trips, partner and programme meetings.
 
Within NRT, gender representation across all staff is 63% men and 37% women and specific to the project activities, we can now report that 10% of all rangeland coordinators are women.","The project is certified Triple Gold under the Climate, Community, and Biodiversity Standard, which requires demonstration of net positive climate, biodiversity, and community benefits at a minimum to acheive Gold certification.

"NativeEnergy, a Public Benefit Corporation",No,Improved livestock grazing for soil health and carbon sequestration,Northern Great Plains Regenerative Grazing Project,Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"The project delivers CDR by sequestering over 1.5 million tonnes of carbon in grassland soils. It is the first and only regenerative grazing U.S. carbon project that will be verified to ICROA-approved standards. It can also be expanded to deliver an additional 7 million tonnes (please see  expansion  attachment), enabling Microsoft to catalyze the first-of-its-kind verified carbon project in the U.S., and bring long-term stability and resilience to this ecosystem and communities that rely upon it.
 
How It Delivers CDR: The project sequesters carbon through increasing grazing intensity and increasing periods of rest and regrowth between grazing events. These improved grazing practices increase grassland productivity, increasing carbon inputs into the soil, and ultimately, increasing levels of soil carbon accrual. 

Co-Benefits: Healthier soils in grassland ecosystems that border Yellowstone National Park will help improve the Park s natural buffer and critical wildlife corridors - part of the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. Healthy soils will also increase the viability of ranchers in the U.S. northern great plains.
 
Participants and Their Roles: NativeEnergy s role is developer/owner of the project and manager of the carbon assets, as well as ongoing monitoring and expansion. WSE conducts rancher outreach and engagement and provides ongoing support to ranchers to develop and implement regenerative grazing management plans. The ranchers co-create and deploy improved grazing management plans over the 30-year project term, allowing soil carbon sampling and third-party verification throughout.
 
How Microsoft s Payments for CDR Will be Used to Catalyze Change: This project provides upfront financing to cattle ranchers to cover capital expenditures, including to acquire fencing and water infrastructure necessary to employ regenerative grazing practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it in soils. Upfront carbon financing overcomes initial barriers to adoption. Ongoing payments (per verified tonne removed from year six on) and the lasting benefits for ranchers sustain these beneficial practices for decades to come, along with a long list of other ecosystem and economic benefits for communities. The project establishes 30-year contracts with ranchers to employ regenerative grazing practices for at least 20 years (the project crediting period), each monitored, verified and reported on over the project s 30-year life.
 
The project land is grassland managed for livestock grazing. The landowners are public and private entities. Participating ranchers own or lease the lands.","Native is the project developer, owner and operator of the project. Native has contracts in place for all credits generated by the project in its initial phase. Native contracts measurement (e.g., soil testing and carbon measurement) and verification (e.g., accredited third-party verifiers) providers, and also has a contractual relationship with Soils for the Future to provide carbon modelling, and with Western Sustainability Exchange to provide rancher outreach and engagement and ongoing support to ranchers to develop and implement regenerative grazing management plans. Native also has contracts with each rancher participating in the project. Specifically, project ownership is held by Native (the project proponent) through enforceable and irrevocable agreements with the holders of the statutory, property or contractual right in the land, vegetation or conservational or management process that generates GHG emission reductions or removals which vests project ownership in the project proponent.

Native is a carbon project developer and retailer and the primary project proponent, with 20 years' experience in the voluntary carbon market. Native is contracted with project participants to ensure permanent and long-term project activities and project goals are met. Western Sustainability Exchange (WSE) is a regional organization committed to preserving the farming and ranching heritage, wildlife habitat, and wide-open spaces of the west while strengthening rural economies. WSE supports land operators in developing their infrastructure plans and grazing plans to increase rest and rotation on their ranches. WSE also provides the workshops and training applicable to the project participants to support their efforts in improving soil health and sequestering carbon. Soils for the Future (SFF) is a soil carbon project developer that is responsible for the soil sampling design and methodology and modeling the soil carbon accruals on the project area. SFF will support annual monitoring.  Native's contracts with the ranches give us the exclusive right to report carbon benefits, and the non-exclusive right to report on project co-benefits, as well as the right to claim causation of both the carbon and co-benefits.
","Overview and General History: Grasslands that once supported bison became home to cattle in the 19th century. The concomitant introduction of fencing led cattle to graze select patches of grasslands without allowing for rest and regrowth of those grasses, leaving the region s soils degraded. However, improved grazing practices build soil carbon and restore soil health, and ranchers are increasingly interested in being part of this change.

Project Conception History: One of Native's project developers has family in Montana who introduced her to the work of the Western Sustainability Exchange.  She reached out to WSE in ~2016 with the idea to leverage the voluntary carbon market and Native's HelpBuildTM upfront finance model to increase WSE's capacity to create ""buy-in"" to the practice of regenerative grazing.  With WSE's encouragement, Native began work on developing the project by engaging Soils for the Future to conduct soil sampling in 2017 to create the foundation for a commercial validation study and validation of the SNAPGraze model for the region.  This study showed that accrual levels and Native's expected cost-share for ranch capital improvements, with other development costs, would likely make for a commercially viable carbon project with a minimum of 40,000 acres participating.  Confirmatory soil sampling was conducted in 2019 to further refine the model for the project area.  
Contracts with the initial 4 ranches were signed in late 2018, and their improved grazing practices began with the next year's grazing season.  Native submitted the PDD for Validation by Aster Global in November, 2020, and has just completed its third round of review.  Validation is expected shortly.

Conversion to cropland.  The return per acre from cropland is materially higher than from grazing in the overall region.  However, the project area is considered degraded and degrading, and thus not particularly well suited for cropland.  In addition, the initial 4 ranches are operated by multigenerational ranching families and are unlikely to change their stripes.
2.  Reversion to open, coninuous grazing.  This risk is considered low.  As the ranchers begin realizing the benefits of improved forage production and increased water retention capacity, the economic benefits of the project to them will incentivize continuation of the project activity.
3.  Loss of leases.  The project area includes leased land, and the leases are shorter than the project life.  The ranchers and most of their lessors expect lease renewals (the U.S. B.L.M. gives current lessees a preference at renewal), but we cannot guarantee continued grazer access to leased land.  Should a lease terminate, Native will work with the lessor to encourage the new lessee to maintaiin the practices and participate in the project.  The risk of lost leases is a factor in the NP risk assessment and buffer pool contributions.  In addition, we expect the rate of ranch recruitment to signficantly exceed the rate of attrition across the project, resulting in continued project-wide carbon gains.",30,30,"The project durability term is 30 years. This is the permanence period required by the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). The VCS standard requires a non-permanence risk assessment and depending on the scoring, a certain deduct is made from issued credits that is set aside in the VCS buffer pool.

Leakage: Using the VCS tool for the assessment of Leakage from Displacement of Grazing Activities, the project activity is not expected to cause a displacement of livestock from within the project area or planned displacement of livestock.  Leakage from displacement of grazing activities is expected to be zero. Project participants are informed of the implications of grazing project animals outside of the project area and are required to report any instances thereof. The project proponent has maps and grazing plans for any currently known instances of animals grazing off project land and will incorporate that into monitoring. Payments to participants are affected by reduced carbon credit issuances. The project proponent does not expect significant leakage, due to the low risk that participants will need to graze in a manner inconsistent with the project activity off the project area. The project activity is expected to benefit productivity of grasslands and ranch operations over time. A market leakage assessment is not possible per the VCS tool, since no commodity supply reductions occur with project activities. (In addition: The displacement of grazing leakage is not expected due to the increase in forage resulting from the project activity. Leakage is being monitored by tracking where all project animals are grazing throughout the durability period. If any animals move off the project area, those grazing impacts are assessed and quantified in the verification reports. The market leakage is similarly not expected due to the increase of forage resulting from the project activity. The flow of any commodity goods from the ranches into local, regional, or global markets is not expected to change based on the project activity.)

Durability, internal: With a combination of education, finance and grazing planning assistance, the project is well suited to enhance the financial viability of ranches that are going concerns in the baseline and create durable changes to their grazing management.  As soil health and forage production improve in the project scenario, the land will become more valuable as grazing land, so even absentee landowners are incentivized to work with Native to gain the engagement of their next lessee in the project activity.  All project participants have financial and management plans in place to continue the practices for the duration of the 30-year VCS project longevity period. 

Durability, external: Landowners are not always the land managers on livestock operations. Our contracts are with the livestock operators, primarily, with statements of commitment for soil health requested of landowners.  Additionally, there is always the possibility that land ownership changes throughout the 30 year permanence period. Native takes on the permanence risk related to land operator and ownership change during the project period and guarantees delivery of credits to buyer.

Durability, natural:     Comments on natural risks: Natural risks pose a much smaller permanence risk to soil carbon than to aboveground biomass carbon pools. These potential losses are expected to be de minimus and will be accounted for at each verification. Drought is likely the highest risk as it slows the ability to sequester carbon with the project activity, but does not reverse it. 

The greatest risk to the project durability is in the case that a landowner sells the project land and the new landowner does not provide management data to allow us to monitor the project area. The risk of a change in landowner for ranches currently included in the project is very low, though we expect to expand to ranches with landowners more likely to change during the durability period. The risk of the new landowner not providing management data is low, however, and we expect the project to be attractive enough to any landowner to continue with the carbon credit contract and minimally provide basic management data needed to monitor the project. 

The other durability risk is in the case that the ranch is sold to a new landowner that plows the land or chooses to graze livestock without any rotations. This risk is low, due to the strength of the livestock business on participating ranches, the marginality of the rangeland for farming, and the expected productivity and financial gains from the project activity.

Our due diligence process when assessing new ranch participants includes a review of the ranch business financial health, ranch organizational management structure, grazing history and proposed grazing change history, and all factors contributing to their strength as a long term partnership with Native on the carbon project.

In addition to our due diligence when assessing new ranch participants, upon executing with a new participant, landowners make statements of public intent, filed with the county clerk, to maintain the project as grassland and manage for soil health for 30 years. We have also committed to pay the ranchers for the improved management practices for the full 20 year crediting period of the project. ",Annual project monitoring over the project lifetime will identify reverals and report those reversals to Microsoft and any other project supporters.,"To achieve the certification level, this project will meet the Verified Carbon Standard requirements - which apply to all VCS AFOLU projects such as this one - to conduct a non-permanence risk analysis to determine a buffer contribution. Depending on the results of the non-permanence risk analysis for the project, a certain percentage of credits are set aside into Verra s buffer pool to account for unintentional carbon removal reversals for any of the standard s verified and issued credits. The greater the non-permanence risk of a project, the higher the number of credits a project must contribute to the buffer pool.
For intentional reversals, Verra requires the project proponent to replace verified issued credits in equal amount to those reversed.  NativeEnergy maintains its own reserve for this purpose.

At the project level, NativeEnergy has 20 year agreements with the land operators to maintain the project activity and 30 year statements of intent with most landowners to keep the project area as grassland. For soil carbon sequestration in grasslands, the greatest threat to reversals is repeated tillage over multiple years. Our due diligence process for selecting project participants limits our exposure to participants who are likely to convert grassland to farmland for these unintentional reversals. Additionally, the project activity is expected to increase forage and subsequently the ranch productivity over time, reducing our long-term reversal risk.

We do not expect unintentional reversals as soil organic carbon is protected underground and published research findings link fire to increased soil organic carbon over the long-term. In addition, as a  grouped � project, all reversal risk is reduced by diffusion among individual ranches with independent decision making and geographic dispersal.","The VCS AFOLU buffer replaces credits for buyers for intentional or unintentional reversals. Drought is the primary risk, which is an unintentional reversal.","The buffer pool is intermixed with credits from all Verra AFOLU projects. Each project is required to conduct the Non-Permanence Risk Assessment, which is validated and verified by the third party Validation and Verification Bodies approved by Verra. This project contributed 16% of otherwise issuable credits into the buffer pool, based on it's Non-Permanence Risk score.","A percentage of the carbon credits are set aside by Verra as a non-permanence insurance buffer against any reversals of credits in the future. For the first monitoring period, we expct this buffer to claim 14% of project credits from 3 of the ranches and 19% from the 4th, a threshold set by Verra over which the project has no control. The credits going into Verra s non-permanence buffer can be used for any of Verra AFOLU projects that may have reversals that are eligible to be claimed out of the buffer and will not be reallocated to this project if no reversals are occur. They contribute permanently to mitigating the reversal risk of all Verra AFOLU projects. ",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Our ideal outcome is collaboration with Microsoft to structure a contract that meets Microsoft's goals while also accelerating expansion of the project, the uptake of regenerative agricultural practices, and the sharing of lessons learned to help others to take similar action. We are open to any volume, tenure and timeline Microsoft proposes.","Our delivery terms are the same as above, though we are open to adjustments that may better suit Microsoft's requirements. Price per tonne is negotiable with a longer deal tenure.","Per our PDD we conducted in-situ baseline sampling, we modelled carbon accruals, and we measure actual accruals over the project lifetime. In-situ sampling and measurement includes soil organic matter and bulk density.

Climate resilience: the project improves drought tolerance and water infiltration of grassland ecosystems and rancher resilience to drought and high rainfall.

SDG 6. Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All.  Indirect contribution to this SDG. The project activity is expected to improve soil health which improves water infiltration and water holding capacity, thus improving the quality of water that reaches water bodies from the project area. The project will be measuring bulk density and soil organic carbon. Bulk density is an indicator of soil porosity and soil compaction, which impact the soil s water retention capacity. Soil organic matter is an indicator of improved soil structure and nutrient holding capacity. Soils that are held together through increased organic matter are less likely to erode through wind or water and create nutrient runoff to waterways. Increased biomass on rested pastures also protects the soil surface from raindrop impact and excessive heating, which further improves infiltration and reduces erosion. Ground and surface water quality may improve by creating a better water filter due to better soil structure, water infiltration, and biological activity. Soil organic matter and bulk density are both indicators measured within each soil sampling.

SDG 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Indirect contribution to this SDG. The project activity is expected to improve the forage productivity and increase the grasslands  resilience to drought and floods, thus improving the viability of the livestock operations (project participants) that depend on the grasslands. The project participants are expected to be able to invest in increasing their herd sizes, thus increasing their annual revenue. The increased labor required to move the cattle more frequently creates job opportunities and project monitoring and compliance checks will ensure labor laws and proper work conditions are met. The project proponent will also be measuring soil organic matter and bulk density. As mentioned in Goal 6, these indicators will support the evidence of improved productivity and resilience. The project also tracks the number of livestock on the project area, thus tracking indirect economic benefits to project participants.

SDG 13. Take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impact. Indirect contribution to this SDG. The project s primary goal is to address greenhouse gas emissions. Soil carbon sequestration will be modelled and measured throughout the project term. In addition to mitigation, the project activity increases the land's resilience to drought, since the increase in perennial grasses increases the land's holding capacity for water. It also increases the forage available to the grazing animals, thus reducing the need for feed to be imported during times of scarcity. 

SDG 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Indirect contribution to this SDG.  The project activity is expected to make the grassland ecosystems within the project area more productive, resilient, and life-sustaining. Soil organic carbon is the indicator that will be measured to represent the project s effect on the health of the grassland ecosystems. An increase in soil organic carbon stocks under the project scenario is modelled to coincide with increases in grassland primary productivity. This increase in primary production will enhance forage availability for both wild and domesticated grazers above and belowground. As carbon accumulates in the soil and biomass increases aboveground, soil water retention will improve and the negative impacts of drought on biodiversity will be lessened. The project activity of high density, short duration grazing will create a mosaic of grassland habitat capable of supporting a more diverse assemblage of native bird and insect species than the uniform  lawns  that characterize the baseline scenario. These benefits are expected to contribute towards this goal s targets to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.

Though we don t actively monitor co-benefits, the project s design is such that it inherently creates them. For example, project activities include providing workshops, learning, and training opportunities for project participants and others. The workshops encourage land operators to increase perennial grass seeding and increase symbiotic soil species activity to accelerate grassland recovery. Additionally, these practices inherently increase business value: thus far the costs for improvements has been ~$12/acre and led to an average increased stocking density of 30%, which, anecdotally, has increased profits, reduced winter feed costs, and increased drought resilience.","One of four counties included in the current phase of the project is classified as a low income region and an average level of education considered  low education � (with 25 percent or more of residents 25 to 64 year old had neither a high school diploma nor a GED) and the project offers open workshops on regenerative grazing and ranch resilience to educate other interested ranchers in the region, whether those ranchers are enrolled in the carbon program or not. Overall, the project focuses on increasing the viability of ranching in the northern plains and helps improve stability and livelihoods, and boost climate resilience into the future.","The Northern Great Plains Grazing Project has a light touch. Native works with ranchers who propose to us the practices and associated infrastructure improvements (fencing and water access) they believe will enable them to improve their grazing practices. These plans are developed with support from our project partner, grazing consultants, and often with support of local NRCS offices. Thus, the project activity comes from those most knowledgeable about, connected to, and impacted by the land and its condition.

The negative environmental impacts are accounted for within the project documentation by calculating the baseline and project emissions associated with any increase in fossil fuel use needed to move the animals more frequently to achieve the project goals of increasing rest/rotation on participating ranches. The methodology also disqualifies any land that has been cleared of native ecosystems, wetlands, or peatlands.",,,,,,
"NativeEnergy, a Public Benefit Corporation",No,Low Disturbance Cropping Project in Palouse,Palouse Carbon Sequestration Project,Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"The Palouse project will produce CDRs through the conduct of Low Disturbance Cropping in the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest.  The project began under a 2011 USDA Conservation Innovation Grant to Applied Ecological Services ( AES �) that funded AES s taking and analysis of 800 soil samples to one-meter depth across the ~7m acre Palouse region.  The grant also funded AES s development of a SOC quantification methodology under the Verified Carbon Standard ( VCS �), for the ultimate, express purpose of developing a carbon offset project using the methodology ( VM0021 �) for SOC quantification.  The soil samples were taken across a sufficient variety of both cropping practices and years under each cropping practice such that a longitudinal statistical model could be constructed to show how accrual rates change and stabilize over time under each of the variety of practices.  The model now predicts SOC stocking levels on fields not sampled (from losses or gains), based on years in the given practice and the stratification of such fields following the stratification requirements of VM0021.  The results from sampling in 2019 on the fields of the farmers who enrolled in the project for purposes of the first Verification of the project confirmed the predictive capability of the regression analysis to a R2 of ~0.96.  This Verification is expected to be completed in Q2, 2022.

Native is the lead project developer, and AES is the lead soil science partner, although both organizations have been developing the project jointly since Native was recruited in 2015 after the default of the prior project developer.  

As VM0021 is a SOC quantification methodology, not a full carbon offset project methodology, Native and AES spent considerable time working with several standards, particularly ACR to develop a methodology that would work for the project, without success.  As discussed further in Attachment 1, the Palouse Validation Criteria, we have opted to validate and verify under ISO 14064-2, as a demonstration project.  The Validation Criteria is comprised of elements each of which is approved and adopted by at least one carbon offset standard, but assembled in a unique combination that is necessary for this project and projects like it to have actual prospects for success.

We invite Microsoft to join us in this demonstration.  Microsoft s funding will be used to back up our commitments to pay the farmers, to fund recruitment, and to grow to scale.

Native has financed, developed and is contracting ranches in the first improved grazing soil carbon project in the grasslands of Montana to credit landowners that improve grazing practices to sequester additional carbon. Native is also actively participating in the work of Science Based Targets, Green America, Noble Foundation s Ecosystem Services Market, Gold Standard s Value Chain Interventions Working Group and other efforts to integrate project-based emission reductions into efforts to reduce emissions in supply chains. 

Native will structure the monitoring and verification of the Palouse project initially under ISO 14064 and against the Palouse Validation Criteria and the VCS VM0021 methodology. Native will also actively engage in the work of Science Based Targets, the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard and Gold Standard s Value Chain Interventions Working Group such that the Palouse project could serve as an intervention whose emission reductions are accounted for in the Scope 3 inventories of companies purchasing wheat and wheat-derived products. In addition to the traditional greenhouse gas monitoring for the VCS, ACR, and ISO standards, tracking agricultural production from farmers enrolled in the Palouse project will be essential to conforming with many of these emerging supply-chain standards, which are intensity-based (emission per unit of production) rather than emissions-based.

3.  Climate change",30,30,"Please see discussion of durability in Attachment 1 to NativeEnergy s Palouse Low Disturbance Cropping Project submission, also attached here as  _NativeEnergy Confidential Attachment 1 Palouse Validation Criteria �

As discussed in our responses to Microsoft s follow-up questions regarding the Palouse project, the minimum 30-year durability term is based on the 30-year minimum project term under the VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool.  Further, also as discussed in those responses, that 30-year minimum durability term is expected to grow in length with respect to each project field as new farms are added to the project over time.  This feature - which continues each field in the project monitoring for reversals beyond each farmers maximum 45 year commitment - is designed to enhance the overall durability of the project, based on the commonsense notion that farmers who have been conducting a practice the longest are those least likely to revert, and their continued maintenance or enhancement of SOC can serve to  cover � those who try it for a few years and go back.

Without the reversal reserve provided for in the Validation Criteria, our durability assessment would lose some confidence, but only with respect to the early years of the project.  As noted in footnote 27 to the Validation Criteria, quoted here, confidence in durability rises quickly with project growth, and the reversal reserve decreases in importance along with it.

The GHG Project Proponent has high confidence that programmatic reversals (i.e., across the grouped project as a whole) will not occur.  The innovators and early actors, who make independent and relatively uncorrelated farming decisions, collectively insure against individual reversals.  Using accrual rates for conventional and LDC farming practices from Applied Ecological Services  soil sampling in the region, the GHG Project Proponent estimates that more than 60% of the Project Participants would have to revert to conventional tillage, all in the same year, for any individual year to experience a programmatic reversal.  The GHG Project Proponent prepared this Palouse Monte Carlo Permanence Simulation to analyze the chance of a programmatic reversal occurring, in which the carbon stocks of all farms enrolled in the program in year 115 fall below the measured and credited carbon stocks in year 15.  The GHG Project Proponent assumes that after a farmer has been verified to have committed to following LDC practices for 15 years that producer has, at most, and a 15% to 20% chance of permanently reverting to conventional tillage from year 16 through 115.  With this conservative assumption, a program of a single Participant would face a 12% to 16% chance of a reversal (in which carbon stocks in year 115 are below the carbon stocks that were credited at the end of year 15).  A grouped project with 12 Participants, on the other hand, has only a 1.9% to 4.6% chance of reversal; with 30 Participants, that probability is reduced to 0.7%.  The GHG Project Proponent acknowledges that the original 15-20% reversion assumption is based on more intuition than data, but the trend is clear:  Regardless what the original 1-participant risk is, as scale is achieved the risk falls to the practical equivalent of zero.","Pursuant to the requirements of VCS VM0021. As discussed in the Validation Criteria, NativeEnergy will be required, at each successive verification, to maintain the reversal reserve  in [an] amount determined to a reasonable level of assurance to be adequate, at the time, to compensate for the statistical probability of project-wide reversal until the later of (i) the 30-year period following initial implementation of the GHG Project, or (ii) the 15-year period following the termination of the crediting period of the last field enrolled in the GHG Project.  Such determination shall be based [on] the Verified rate of Project Participants  reversion to management practices that cause SOC losses, the statistically [sic] the area covered by such practices and the statistically expected loss rates from those practices, based on the data from the 2012, 2019 and all subsequent samplings. �  See p. 14-15.

How big that is depends on how big the project is at the time.  Our present estimates for the initial 38 farmers, assuming no crediting period renewals and no additional recruitment, is a 13% reversal reserve.  Depending on the size and duration of Microsoft s commitment to the project, NativeEnergy would be happy to work with Microsoft to establish a reversal reserve in an amount deemed adequate by Microsoft, and even to put title to the VERs in the reversal reserve in escrow for the benefit of Microsoft.","The primary reversal risk is reversion to tillage cropping.  For the early adopters, this risk is very low, as their conduct of LDC is now ""how they farm"" with zero reversion over many years.  This risk across the project is reduced as the project grows in acreage and farmers.  Statistically, the impact of reversions at a few farms is overwhelmed by project-wide accruals on the remaining and new farms.  See discussion in the Palouse Validation Criteria.","NativeEnergy will be required to maintain a verified reversal reserve. See the Palouse Validation Criteria for details.

Farms are primarily growing wheat, which is supplied to ADM Milling, but also grow sunflower and canola oil.

2: The combination of the carbon payment, fossil fuel savings and premium for sustainably farmed wheat is expected to increase the average farm s revenue by $149,000 to $155,000 per year; Given current wheat prices, this premium represents a 19% increase in annual farm income; All 58 farms participating will benefit from new income generating opportunities of monetizing the climate benefit of their sequestration.

3: Program is anticipated to sequester between 60,000 and 125,000 mtCO2e per year for 15 years, with a total reduction of over 1.9 million mtCO2e.

4: The acres anticipated to be enrolled in the program will be certified under either the Pacific Northwest Direct Seed Association s Farmed Smart Sustainable Agriculture Certification or Shepherd s Grain s Food Alliance Sustainability Standard; As discussed in Appendix D of the Methodology, soil carbon erosion loss rates in the Palouse have been documented at 50% to 70% since moldboard plowing began in the 1800s.

Natural Capital Exchange Inc.,Yes,Microsoft pays US landowners to accelerate forest CDR.,The Natural Capital Exchange,Forestry (removal only),,,Improved Forest Management,"The Natural Capital Exchange (NCX) is a data-driven forest carbon marketplace that leverages innovative technology to drive carbon removal at scale by opening participation to forest landowners of all sizes. This mechanism bridges operational, acre-level forest management with holistic, landscape-level CDR. 

Microsoft payments for CDR via NCX will incentivize landowners to change their harvest behavior, resulting in additional carbon stored on the landscape. By lowering the amount of harvest activity on their properties for a 1-year project period, higher volumes of CDR are enabled. As this program runs year over year, the average age of forests will increase relative to business as usual. The net result is an additional increase in total forest biomass across the landscape, resulting in durable additional removal of carbon from the atmosphere.

The marketplace is underpinned by Basemap, our high-resolution forest inventory map developed in collaboration with Microsoft  AI for Earth  that combines remote sensing, machine learning, statistical models and field measurements to measure the sizes and species of trees on every acre across the U.S..The NCX approach uses Basemap technology to improve on traditional forest carbon projects by assessing an acre-level baseline, increasing transparency through rigorous data science and remote sensing measurement and evaluation, and opening up participation to all forest owners, including the 200 million acres owned by small forest landowners previously excluded from forest carbon markets. 

To date, NCX has contracted with more than 700 landowners across 16 states in our forest carbon marketplace, with an expected climate impact of 600K permanent MT CO2e. The parcels owned by these landowners range in size from fewer than 20 acres up to more than one million acres. You can read more about these exchanges in our 2021 Spring Cycle Report for Microsoft and our 2021 Summer Cycle Report for Microsoft, attached as Supplemental Document #8 and #9 to this submission. 

NCX s upcoming Winter 2022 cycle will include participation from landowners across the lower-48 states and all forest types, with select areas excluded due to the challenges of collecting necessary ground measurements in January 2022 in particularly snowy regions. 

 Later in 2022, credits will be available from select regions in Canada and Mexico. 

","NCX offers a vertically integrated solution to this RFP, meaning we are both the project developer and the credit broker/marketer. We engage directly with Verra and a verification/validation body to certify the credits we generate (we are actively engaged in the Verra methodology approval process now) and orchestrate all elements of field measurement, verification, etc. 

There are three notable categories of partners and subcontractors engaged in our projects.

1. Verifiers. These are third-party, independent verifiers engaged in accordance with the verification requirements of Verra. The specific verifier entities for our projects in this RFP response have not been identified, but will meet the full requirements of Verra and will have regionally relevant forest experience.

2. Timber cruising teams for ground measurements. The carbon methodology underlying our projects requires field measurements to refine its remote sensing estimates of carbon stocks and landscape activity. NCX contracts this work with regional third-parties that meet our standards for expertise, professionalism, integrity, and cost-effectiveness. 

3. Individual partners/contractors. 
In developing our methodology, NCX has consulted with and incorporated input from a variety of partners. These include academic subject experts, NGOs, potential buyers, and other thought leaders at the forefront of carbon accounting. NCX has worked with and received expressions of general support for ton-year accounting from the following entities:

Dr. Binkley supports and has consulted informally on the NCX program structure and methodology. NCX anticipates that Dr. Binkley may take on a formal advisory role. 


Separate from the partners listed above, primary participants in the Natural Capital Exchange include carbon buyers, forest landowners & managers, and consulting foresters acting as representatives for their landowner clients.



Regarding NCX s management's capacity to secure all planned carbon, environmental, and social benefits:

1. NCX bases its entire internal workflow in a task management application with Gantt chart and similar functionality. This allows our fully remote team to effectively coordinate with one another. In addition, we have a CRM (Hubspot) and database to manage landowner relationships and obligations.
 
2. In terms of personnel, there are two relevant organizational practices. The first is our use of a  Product/Project Manager  framework, which assigns overall accountability for a product or project (as relevant) to a single individual, who s then responsible for maintaining a strategic roadmap and delegating appropriately. Our carbon program has a dedicated Director and Analyst, freeing our technical, biometrics, and operational leads to focus on their domains. The second relevant practice is our Leadership Team, consisting of the CEO, COO, Chief Sustainability Officer, Chief Data Scientist, Chief Technology Officer, Director of Marketing, Head of Business Development and Chief Financial Officer/Program Director. This group meets weekly to maintain communication about all relevant project timelines. 

3. As of August 2021, we also have hired a Chief Sustainability Officer who has extensive experience in ESG and sustainability roles. She will ensure our carbon program adheres to the highest environmental and social standards and that we stay aligned with emerging industry knowledge and trends.

","Since 2010, NCX has developed precision forestry tools to help forest managers sustainably and profitably manage their forests. Based on technology developed at the Yale School of Forestry by NCX co-founder Zack Parisa, the company worked with many of the largest government, commercial, and conservation-focused landowners in the United States. For example, NCX provided our nationwide forest data to the US Forest Service through a sole-source contract for its pest and pathogen modeling.

In 2016, NCX began providing technical and methodological support for forest carbon project developers. The company assisted with the measurement, baselining, analysis, accounting, and verification for California Air Resources Board (CARB) forest carbon projects. Notably, NCX developed the first (and to our knowledge, the only) remote sensing method accepted by CARB for forest carbon baseline accounting. In this role, NCX performed a technical service known as ""assessment area delineation and classification"" for 22 forest carbon projects totaling over 20 million tons of carbon. More details are provided in Supplemental Document #1 - CARB Project Experience that is attached in this submission. 

In 2018, NCX collaborated with Microsoft s  AI for Earth  program to develop Basemap, the first high-resolution, remote-sensing based forest inventory of the continental US. Basemap combines remote sensing, machine learning, statistical models and field measurements to produce lists of the trees, including their species and size, on every acre of forest in the US and underpins our forest carbon marketplace.

In 2019, NCX and Microsoft partnered to pilot the Natural Capital Exchange, our  data-driven market mechanism to originate CDR credits from landowners of all sizes in Pennsylvania. 20 landowners participated in the pilot with a total of 66,869 acres enrolled. 6,861 permanent tons of CO2e were removed from the atmosphere in this pilot. 

In January 2021, NCX announced the close of a $4.4M seed financing round co-led by Union Square Ventures and Version One Ventures, and joined by other funds and private investors including Marc Benioff, Ben Silbermann, Mark Tercek, Scribble Ventures, Gratitude Railroad, Alpha Edison, CoFound Partners, CRCM, and others. 

In April 2021, NCX held its first commercial scale forest carbon exchange. With participating acreage totaling  1.17 million acres, NCX s first commercial exchange included 119 landowners across 10 states with an expected climate impact of over 100,000 permanent tons of CO2e removed from the atmosphere. Landowners with forests comprising more than 10 million acres signed up to have their forests  evaluated as part of the program via our online, easy-to-use platform. 

In May 2021, NCX announced a $20 million Series A financing round led by TIME Ventures, the venture fund of Marc Benioff. The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund and NCX s seed investors - Union Square Ventures and Version One Ventures - also participated in the round. NCX plans to use the funds to grow our team on both the demand and supply sides of our market as well as to expand internationally. NCX rebranded from SilviaTerra to NCX to signify the company s focus on the Natural Capital Exchange. 

In July 2021, NCX held its second commercial scale carbon exchange. 577 landowners in 16 states across the US Southeast, Lake States, and Appalachian regions contractually committed to defer the timber harvest of their forests. 61% of those properties were under 750 acres in size. NCX s one-year contract terms and data-driven approach differ from traditional forest carbon projects, enabling greater participation from smaller, family landowners. The expected climate impact for the NCX summer cycle is approximately 500K MTCO2e removed from the atmosphere. 
",1/1/2022,Atlanta,GA,United States,1000000,2000000,Yes,1000000,3000000,1000000,4500000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,,6000000,100,100,"The NCX program pays landowners for retained growth on their property during the activity period and landowners are rewarded for storing more carbon on their land than would have been stored under a BAU scenario. The impact of each aggregated project is expressed in terms of enhanced carbon storage on the landscape of contracted properties. The proportion of credits generated by a particular project that can be classified as  carbon removal � or  avoided emissions � depends on whether our forest of contracted properties is a source or a sink under BAU. With very few exceptions, since forests in the CONUS are currently acting as carbon sinks, our program can be classified as 100% removals.

Please see Supplemental Document #10 - Removals Brief (attached in the  Removal Percentage Follow-up � question below), for additional detail about how NCX views  removals versus avoidance/emission reductions for our projects. ",No,Verra (VCS),,N/A,,,Yes,,"1. Lack of data as we scale internationally: As NCX expands beyond the United States, data may not be as readily available in international geographies. NCX may have to use 3rd party datasets to supplement NCX data. 

2. Voluntary carbon market policy hindering innovation: NCX is a new approach to forest carbon markets with strategies and processes beyond traditional carbon markets. It is vital that policy allows for innovative projects that are an improvement on traditional projects. NCX mitigates this risk by serving as an advisor to various cross-sector groups. For example, NCX CEO Zack is a member of the Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, which is focused on ensuring the voluntary carbon market scales with credible and transparent standards. NCX is a part of the 1t.org U.S. Chapter and a member of the Forest Climate Working Group (a coalition focused on U.S. forests). In addition, Zack and other NCX team members are expert advisors in using ton-year accounting to advance the voluntary carbon market scalability and quality.

3. Delivery risk - that landowners will not end up delivering on their obligations: Performance risk of landowners is mitigated by having a large, diversified set of landowners, which means they are less correlated with respect to unintentional non-delivery (i.e. natural disasters like floods, fires and hurricanes) and also with respect to intentional non-delivery (e.g. they are in different markets, so even if timber prices go way up in one location, all of our landowners won't rush out and harvest their timber). If we were just sourcing from one landowner or one region, the risk from both of these effects would be higher. See Supplemental Document #3 - Landowner Performance and Monitoring - for more information on how NCX is tracking landowner performance. 
",10000,10000,"How we account for durability and risk of reversal is laid out in Supplemental Document #4, our latest Ton-Year Accounting and Permanence Brief. 
","Once NCX carbon credits have been delivered, there is no risk of reversal of climate impact due to the permanent ton-year accounting approach. In addition, NCX is a  payment upon delivery � project - no payments are made to project landowners until carbon has been verifiably and transparently accounted for as permanently removed. Therefore, reversal risk is eliminated. 

 We monitor avoidable and unavoidable reversals during the year-long performance period prior to credit issuance. We account for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals prior to credit delivery through project design (ie. creating a project level buffer pool to account for delivery risk). Please see the following two questions and our attached Supplemental Document #3 - Landowner Performance and Monitoring for more information on how we monitor landowner performance.
","NCX s year-long terms through NCX s ton-year accounting methodology eliminate Microsoft s exposure to reversals following credit delivery. This is in direct contrast with cases where a buyer or project investor pays upfront for a carbon credit that represents a stream of impacts in the future that must be monitored for decades to account for intentional or unintentional reversals. 

Risk of reversal for NCX credits applies during the one-year period, not after it. NCX has a large, diversified set of  suppliers � (i.e. landowners) which dilutes the risk that any one reversal event would prevent credit delivery. For our 2022 cycles, credits will be sourced from all over the country. This means that these credits are less correlated with respect to unintentional non-delivery (e.g. hurricanes) and also with respect to intentional non-delivery (e.g. they are in different markets, so even if timber prices go way up in one location, all of our landowners won't rush out and harvest their timber). If we were just sourcing from one landowner or one region, the risk from both of these effects would be higher. 

NCX mitigates risk of landowner non-performance in part through our landowner Seller Agreement, which includes a comprehensive  Seller Performance � payment section in 3.1C with an accompanying graphic on the final page (see here: https://landowners.ncx.com/NCX_Seller_Agreement_EXAMPLE.pdf). This section explains how under delivery results in reduced payments, or in some cases non-payment. 

Supplemental Document #3 - Landowner Performance and Monitoring details the kinds of intentional or unintentional risks that NCX monitors and accounts for.

","As described in the previous section, NCX projects have no risk of reversal, intentional or unintentional. 

Incidentally, NCX uses a project-level buffer pool to account for potential delivery risk; i.e. less than 100% of the total expected credits generated are pre-sold to buyers. 

","NCX buffer pools are composed of only credits from this project. 
","Buffer pool percentages vary according to project-specific risk factors.
",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Our ideal outcome is a 2- or 3-year forward purchase agreement, with NCX commitments to deliver fixed volumes of credits, at pre-specified prices, at dates in the future. Preliminary volumes and prices are stated above; NCX would expect to discuss future pricing in the context of volume commitments. 
","NCX manages delivery risk in several different ways, including by only selling forward a portion of the credit volume we expect to generate. NCX is also in discussions with risk management partners (e.g., commodities trading and marketing groups) about methods for backstopping NCX forward sale agreements, thereby reducing the volumetric risk to forward credit buyers like Microsoft. Upon confirming Microsoft s interest in a multi-year offtake agreement, we d engage in 3-way conversations with those potential partners to see if risk management terms can be arranged that add value to the parties.
","Our carbon removal/sequestration is measured using a combination of remote sensing, machine learning, statistical models, and field measurements. The remote sensing comes from sources such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 and the field plot data comes through the public federal FIA database, as well as other partners. All these inputs form NCX s Basemap, a high-resolution forest inventory map of every forested acre in the U.S. that was developed in partnership with Microsoft s  AI for Earth  program.

Basemap is generated at a 30-meter resolution and measures forest composition and structure along with the individual sizes and species of each tree on each acre. From this information, we estimate the carbon, timber value, wildlife habitat quality and other metrics associated with the trees on each acre. 

We combine this Basemap data with on the ground field measurements on a sampling of properties at the beginning and end of the performance period to further hone our modeling. These field measurements validate whether the amount of carbon on the landscape has changed relative to what we would expect regarding our calculated business as usual scenario. 

",366000,40.5,,"By partnering with NCX, Microsoft achieves measurable co-benefits, and supports the development of a data-driven platform through which all benefits from forests - water stewardship, wildlife habitat, wildfire risk mitigation, etc.-- are quantified and ultimately valued. Our vision for the Natural Capital Exchange is to expand beyond carbon to facilitate the trade and manifestation of all of these valuable ecosystem services from forests.

1. Ecosystem protection:
In line with SDG 15, sustainable forest management is the ultimate aim of and underpins NCX's program. NCX gives society a lever to drive sustainable forest management and ecosystem protection at scale. For example, in addition to forest carbon outcomes, NCX quantifies wildlife species habitat quality. Unlike traditional forest carbon projects that report on wildlife species protection in a qualitative way, our scientists provide quantitative metrics to measure the impact of investments in forest carbon on wildlife co-benefits. Our 2021 Spring cycle measured habitat quality of two bird species and the white-tailed deer, and our 2021 Summer cycle added measurements for the Canada lynx and Snowshoe hare. We expect in the future to not only measure wildlife habitat quality but also to transact biodiversity credits.

2. Social equity and justice:
In line with SDG 8 and SDG 11, NCX's program provides an economic alternative for landowners who have traditionally been excluded from carbon markets, creating an inclusive market  and an alternative source of income for millions of families across rural communities. NCX empowers these communities to be paid to sustainably manage their forests for more than just the timber. NCX's one-year terms do not lock landowners into multi-generational contracts - creating the flexibility to manage forests as needed to maintain resilient and sustainable ecosystems while not encumbering future generations with contracts designed decades ago.


3. Climate action: 
In line with SDG 13, NCX eliminates enrollment costs for millions of landowners across the United States, enabling mass participation in forest carbon markets in this critical decade for the climate. NCX's data and approach  also ensures real, verifiable, and quantifiable climate impact for companies aiming to achieve their net zero goals. 
","NCX uses our Basemap dataset to quantify more than the timber and carbon value in US forests. For example, we pair Basemap s acre-level insights on forest composition with ecological models to understand habitat quality, or acres where species would likely occur. We measure landowner participation each cycle to understand who is participating and why. Our vision for the Natural Capital Exchange is to empower all landowners to be paid to manage their forests for all of the valuable ecosystem services from forests, beyond just carbon. 
","There s a widely-acknowledged risk that the transition to a low-carbon economy will be led by the segments of society that already benefit disproportionately from advances and investments in innovation and technology, leaving behind the rest. Equitable and inclusive forest carbon markets cut squarely against this risk, aligning rural communities with conservation and climate progress, and allowing them to share in the value created by climate regulation  technologies  broadly defined, which have always included natural climate solutions. 

In particular, small- and medium-size forest landowners have been almost entirely excluded from forest carbon markets to date, relegating over 200 million productive US forest acres to the climate sideline. By dramatically reducing transaction costs and reducing the carbon contract length to 1 year, NCX opens market participation to this entire segment, giving them access to carbon payments on equal terms with larger institutional landowners. In addition to diversifying small landowner income streams and offering payments for previously unrecognized value, annual carbon markets like NCX also de-risk family asset ownership by distributing return realization across many years, instead of concentrating it in infrequent, one-off harvesting events. This helps keep forests as forests and contributes to the economic base of rural communities. Through economic engagement, these communities can participate more constructively in the climate conversation and help develop climate solutions.

","The carbon methodology underpinning NCX projects is conservative in the sense that it doesn t take credit for the positive GHG impact of the deferred harvest activity beyond the carbon sequestered and removed by the trees themselves (i.e. delayed and/or reduced fossil fuel usage from less trucks driving to the mill or other non-biological harvesting activities) in the project. 

NCX projects also avoid harm to landowners in a couple important ways. First, there is a long history of social inequity in agriculture (writ large) that this project avoids by including landowners of all types and sizes, including ones that have been historically excluded from market participation. Second, NCX avoids locking landowners into long-term contracts that might hurt or disadvantage them in the future. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the future, long-term (e.g. 100-year) contracts run the major risk of turning out to be suboptimal for landowners--the term is simply too long to know in advance. NCX 1-year contracts avoid this problem, and allow landowners to integrate carbon sales into the year-over-year, economically optimal management of their forest assets. 

The project has de minimis risk of encouraging deforestation or other forestry-related emissions increases. Any such risk would come from leakage of harvest activity to other forest areas around the globe, which is incorporated into the calculation of removals. Our discussion of activity-shifting and market leakage suggests this risk is minor. Please see this Supplemental Document #5 - Market Leakage Assessment for an overview on how NCX is going beyond standard leakage deduction factors to account for market leakage on an acre level, to bring more transparency and accuracy to leakage calculations.

"Natural Capital Partners Americas, LLC",,Reforesting Nicaragua: Regenerating forest ecosystems with smallholder farmers,The CommuniTree Carbon Program,Afforestation/reforestation,,,,"The CommuniTree Carbon program is an award winning carbon project and has become the largest reforestation initiative in Nicaragua. Working with farming families across the Northwest of Nicaragua, the project helps them to grow forests on under used farmland which was historically deforested. Typically, the farmland is owned by family farmers themselves, with the average farm around 2 hectares in size. The project is built around putting the needs of the farmers it works with first, helping them grow native tree species and build forest-based enterprises in order to create sustainable livelihoods for the long term. These forests are creating financial resilience for over 2,500 farming families traditionally earning only $2 a day, regenerating biodiverse habitats across over 6,000 hectares, and storing over 890,000 tonnes of CO2.  The project combines a community first approach with forest science and cutting-edge technologies. The project team is made up of cross-disciplinary local and international experts in forestry, business, smallholder economics, computer science and remote sensing. With over a decade of delivering successful outcomes, their work has been showcased and used as a best-practice reforestation model by organizations including the UN, EU and Mesoamerican Alliance of Peoples and Forests.      As a co-funder of the project’s tree planting and carbon credit offtake activities, the Arbor Day Foundation has planted 275,000 trees and co-originated and 50,000 metric tons of carbon credits to-date.    Microsoft’s payments for the proposed future years CDR new supply will help to grow the project from incremental growth to transformative, scalable expansion. The payments will be used to recruit more farmers to the program and fund operations to reforest more land with them. At least 60% of Microsoft’s payments will be delivered directly to the farmers and their communities in the form of cash and material payments to incentivise them to reforest their land. The majority of the other 40% will be put towards project running costs such as local staffing, farmer visits and training and all the necessary materials needed to operate the project successfully. As well as delivering a natural climate solution, Microsoft’s payments will help the program to scale and expand across Nicaragua, helping thousands of farmers to diversify their income and build resilience in the face of climate change.

Using a combination of field data, satellite imagery and localized machine learning algorithms, FARM-TRACE creates a near real time dashboard of the program’s performance. This dashboard is used to make informed management decisions and to report results to third parties. You can see the impacts of Taking Root’s Nicaragua program here: https://app.farm-trace.com/en/communitree  Through FARM-TRACE, Taking Root monitors and reports all carbon removals and reversals using three interrelated approaches.    1)	Expert site visits: Each farmer within the program is assigned to a local field technician who is responsible for overseeing that farm’s success over time. This field technician visits each farm to evaluate underperforming areas, coach the farmer on how to fix these issues and report each visit including a geo-tagged photo using the FARM-TRACE mobile app. When online, this data is synced to the FARM-TRACE web platform to track how often each farm is being visited, its challenges and progress towards addressing those challenges. The frequency of these visits starts off at 17 visits per year in the first year and progressively declines in frequency as the trees grow and the farmer becomes more experienced.    2)	Carbon inventories: The second approach is based on systematic field measurements that report the inventory of carbon sequestered within the trees grown on farms. The field measurements are done within randomly located sampling plots that cover 10% of the area of every farm. Within these sampling plots, all the trees are measured and entered into the FARM-TRACE mobile app. When online, the mobile app is synced to the FARM-TRACE web platform and forestry and carbon statistics are calculated using the most comprehensive database of pan-tropical biomass equations published in the academic literature (collated by Taking Root), which convert tree measurements into carbon estimates for the farm. These field measurements are performed the first year a farm is planted and at least every five years thereafter.    3)	Remote sensing: The third approach to measuring carbon removals and reversals uses satellite imagery interpreted using a localized machine learning algorithm through the FARM-TRACE platform. These satellite images are acquired over every farm monthly and interpreted to calculate carbon based on relationships that are created using the field measurements.     As well as its continuous impact tracking through FARM-TRACE, Taking Root provides an annual report each year which is reviewed by Plan Vivo before the issuance credits each year. In each annual report any reversals are reported. In addition, every 5 years the program is audited by an external third party to ensure reporting is accurate and the programme is delivering its claimed impacts. The program was last audited in 2016 by Rainforest Alliance and not only passed but were given an award for best practice monitoring practices the year before https://takingroot.org/2015/08/monitoring-award-from-rainforest-alliance/. The next external audit is due next year in 2021.    The following recourses are used in the event of premature reversals.   1)	Program design: The program is designed to take into account reversals before they have happened by reforesting more land each year than required to generate the carbon credits which have been sold.  This means in most cases, actual reversals on individual farms are less than what was planned so no real reversal takes place.     2)	Farm replacements: Taking Root replaces failed farms with entirely new farms at its own expense to make up for losses at the farm level. This is in part possible because Taking Root holds a special fund designated for farmer payments based on success over time. When failures occur, the money earmarked for future payments can be re-deployed to new farms.    3)	Pool risk buffer: Every year Taking Root delivers 15% of its credits generated for that year into a Plan Vivo pool risk buffer. All Plan Vivo projects around the world contribute to this buffer and can call upon it. If there is a shortfall in one project, it can be compensated for through credits generated by other Plan Vivo projects around the world.

Taking Root’s team includes a growing team of six software developers who are maintaining and building the platform. The organization would welcome skills based volunteering and knowledge sharing from Microsoft to build the organization’s technology capacity including:  -	Improving product management processes and quality assurance  -	Enhancing the user interface and experience of the FARM-TRACE platform  -	Support on specific coding challenges or reviews such as reviewing FARM-TRACE’s machine learning capabilities and areas for improvement  -	Providing feedback as a funder on reporting and insights which it would like to see from forest projects which could be built into the platform.     This partnership would not only enhance the reporting and operations of the CommuniTree carbon project but help drive innovation to unlock opportunities for forest conservation, restoration and regeneration activities at scale around the world.     ","Software Innovation: Over the last 5 years, Taking Root has developed a cutting edge monitoring and reporting platform, FARM-TRACE. FARM-TRACE provides project developers and funders with unparalleled impact transparency. From tracking forest cover and carbon stored over time to project activities, FARM-TRACE provides automated, verified insights into farm-level impacts so project developers can spend less time on time consuming and expensive reporting processes, and more time creating and communicating impacts with confidence. FARM-TRACE does this while giving farmers ownership of the data they produce so they get rewarded for their climate smart farming practices and can use the same information to improve their farm’s production. By combining mobile, satellite and machine learning data, FARM-TRACE provides rigorous and engaging reporting to implement and invest in project activities effectively to maximise impact. FARM-TRACE is already being used across thousands of farms with some of the world’s leading environmental and commodity brands to catalyze reforestation and climate smart farming practices with smallholder farmers around the world. An overview of FARM-TRACE can be found in the accompanying documents.    Hardware Innovation: In 2020 Taking Root delivered the completion of a 3 year R&D project with Engineering Firm, Thermotech Combustion, to develop a biochar reactor suitable for smallholder farming contexts and which minimises emissions through the biochar’s creation. The first prototype reactor is now live. Wood is being bought from farmers helping create an additional source of income for them and then being used to create sustainable biochar. This biochar is currently being tested across tree nurseries and in the project’s coffee agroforestry plots to assess the optimal application with trees in order to enhance tree growth, mortality rates and support organic farming practices. At the same time the biochar buried in the soil is storing carbon. Through this testing phase, Taking Root is aiming to create a model it can then scale across its program and to others around the world.     Input innovation: The project is always seeking new ways to enhance sustainable farming practices. One example of this is the project’s work to implement new composting techniques to help farmers implement organic farming practices. In 2019, the project built a composting reactor to test how natural processes could create alternative farm inputs for farmers. This would not only help them reduce costs but also a reliance on synthetic fertilizers. More can be read about this innovation here:  https://takingroot.org/2019/07/going-organic-mission-impossible-for-smallholder-farmers/  ","Taking Root’s work is carefully designed to improve environmental and social impacts with a list of risks and mitigation measures in the Table below. From an environmental perspective, the program only uses tree species that are native and well adapted to the region to recreate lost forests on underutilized lands. From a social perspective, the program works specifically to create livelihood opportunities for marginalized communities and was co-designed by the community specifically to maximize social impact and minimize possible harms.

"Natural Capital Partners Americas, LLC",,Community Reforestation in Kenya with Smallholder and Subsistence Farmers,"“TIST Program in Kenya, VCS 00#” (there are 7 registered sub-projects from Kenya)",Afforestation/reforestation,,,,"•	The Kenya Community Reforestation project organizes hundreds of small community-based tree planting initiatives on lands owned by smallholder and subsistence farmers. Under traditional practices, farmers clear trees to increase available agricultural land, a process which erodes quality by removing nutrients from the soil. Forestry projects such as this combine carbon sequestration with sustainable development, helping to improve community livelihoods through education and training, and create additional sources of income beyond smallholder farming.  •	The program started in Kenya in 2004, set up by the Carbon Asset Developer, a grassroots initiative organizing participating farmers into small groups that work together, providing training on aspects of sustainable forestry and farming, tree nurseries, efficient stoves, etc. Some participants are also trained to become “quantifiers”, using handheld devices to monitor the growth of trees.  •	The project is implemented on lands owned or controlled by the participating small hold farmers, who own the trees that they plant, thus the species are selected by them, based on their needs and the benefits of each species. The program provides training on species as well as guidelines for planting groves, for example at least 30% of a grove must be indigenous trees, and no Eucalyptus can be planted within 100 meters of a waterway. As a result, numerous species and varieties have been selected. The program helps to break the local cycle of deforestation, drought and famine, as the trees reduce erosion, stabilize and enrich the soil, and provide shade. Once mature, the trees will provide other benefits too, including edible fruits and nuts, medicines, windbreaks, firewood and timber.  •	Much recent planting in Kenya under this program has been of fruit trees, which will provide an additional valuable crop to the participants. However, the majority of removals still come from other species selected by the farmers at an earlier stage; in the most recent verification period for project VCS 005, for example, 37% of removals came from Grevillea, 19% from Eucalyptus, 17% cypress and 27% all other species. As Eucalyptus has long been promoted by the Kenyan Forest Service as an attractive species, farmers have followed government advice and this makes up a significant proportion of the stock, but the program has helped incentives farmers to reduce the number of Eucalyptus and plant alternative species.  •	Profits from the carbon revenues are shared with the participating farmers.

This means that monitoring takes place every 5 years or more frequently, and only additional removals are credited, which means that any partial reversals are automatically compensated. In addition, the VCS operates a buffer for all land-use projects. TIST monitors all of its trees and project areas approximately every 18 months.  During the monitoring, all trees in a project area are counted, and a statistically significant number are measured.  This information is used to determine the cumulative biomass and carbon removals.  It is compared to the amount removed during the prior monitoring periods so that the net change in removal can be established.  A gain becomes new credits.  A loss would mean a reversal.

Benefits include reduced erosion, stabilized and enriched soil, shade as well as edible fruits and nuts, medicines, windbreaks, firewood and timber. By planting on their own land, TIST farmers are offsetting the need to deforest natural forests.  They can use their trees to provide a sustainable fuel supply by pruning and using wood from natural mortality and forestry thinning.    •	The program provides training on species as well as guidelines for planting groves, for example at least 30% of a grove must be indigenous trees, and no Eucalyptus near a waterway.

Neustark AG,Yes,Mineralization of biogenic CO2 in demolition concrete,CO2 sequestration cluster Bern,Biomass conversion with carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) (including BECCS),,,,"The mineralization plant that sequesters CO2 in demolition concrete is located at a concrete recycler (Ka¤stli Bau Ag) next to Bern, Switzerland. The biogenic CO2 is sourced from the wastewater treatment plant Ara Region Bern (Switzerland) that produces biogas from sewage sludge and other biogenic wastes - biomass that previously took up the CO2 from the atmosphere. Biogas consists of 60% of methane and 40% of CO2. To increase the calorific value of the biogas, they perform biogas upgrading that removes the CO2 from the biogas. In the past, they released the biogenic CO2 again into the atmosphere. Neustark now liquefies about 500 t of CO2 in 2021/2022 in order to transport it to the mineralization plant. Already today, the concrete recycler crushes multiple ten thousand tons of demolition concrete into concrete aggregate and removes reinforcing steel bars. The concrete aggregate is stored in a silo on site before it is reused for the production of new concrete or for road construction. Neustark retrofitted the already existing silos with the mineralization plant. The liquefied CO2 passes through a reboiler before it enters the silo. In the silo, the CO2 reacts with the cement phases of the concrete aggregate and is chemically converted to CaCO3. In other words, the CO2 is mineralized to stone and thus permanently stored. 
Moreover, at the end of a monitoring period, we collect the data and generate a monitoring report along a Gold Standard methodology, which is currently in the review phase. This monitoring report considers the amount of CO2 mineralized as well as emissions generated along the value chain  “ in order to determine the net-negative CO2-eq. emission. This monitoring report is third party validated  “ and credits are issued to our Gold Standard registry. The CO2 certificates are the only products financing the whole mineralization value chain. Microsoft s payment for CDR will be used to refund the costs, various stakeholders had along the value chain, it will help to expand our activities, scale our CDR and thus reduce the cost.
","Neustark manages the overall value chain which involves:
1.	Liquefaction of CO2 (by Neustark)  “ which is supplied by Ara Region Bern (by pipeline)
2.	Transport of neustark s liquid CO2 semitrailer by company Salzmann AG to Ka¤stli Bau AG 
3.	CO2 storage in neustark CO2 mineralization plant operated by Ka¤stli Bau AG
4.	Data collection and CO2 monitoring performed by neustark 
5.	Validation & Verification of the monitoring report by Gold Standard reviewers or equivalent
6.	Hand-over of negative emission certificates / 3rd party verified monitoring report or equivalent to Microsoft by neustark
","After a successful testing phase with our pilot plant, Ka¤stli Bau signed mid August 2021 a contract to retrofit their two silos with a neustark plant. Neustark will build the plant this year and beginning of 2022 the plant will be ready for mineralization. Since July 2021, neustark has its own liquefaction plant which is located at the wastewater treatment plant Ara Region Bern. The liquefaction plant liquefies the CO2 which is separated from the biogas during biogas upgrading.

Ocean Networks Canada,Yes,Offshore direct air capture with ocean basalt-based carbon sequestration,Solid Carbon,Direct air capture and storage</span,,,,"Solid Carbon is an offshore negative emissions technology that aims to turn carbon dioxide (CO2) into rock. Ocean Networks Canada is leading Solid Carbon along with an international team of researchers committed to advancing technology to draw CO2 from the air and inject it below the seafloor into ocean basalt. There, it will react with the basalt and mineralize into rock, providing a durable and vast reservoir for Carbon Dioxide Removal(CDR). This ambitious project follows a globally scalable systems approach that is urgently required to meet planetary climate targets.

In essence, Solid Carbon is integrating six separate, yet proven technologies into a fully integrated system that will extract CO2 from the atmosphere through (1/6) Direct Air technology, installed on an (2/6) ocean floating platform, powered by (3/6) wind, solar, and/or thermal energy, and (4/6) injects the CO2 into the subsea floor (5/6) using offshore drilling technology, where it will (6/6) react with the basalt and mineralize into stable rock.

Based on the success of the Carbfix project in Iceland with onshore Basalt (where CO2 converted into carbonates within 2 years), Solid Carbon aims to build on this by demonstrating the efficacy of carbon sequestration in ocean basalt, which constitutes over 90% of basalt on Earth. We propose to design and conduct a field test of CO2 injection into ocean basalt, tracking the hydrological and geochemical impacts of permanent sequestration, and evaluate new and established monitoring approaches to ensure safety. 

An offshore hydrogeological experiment will take place at Ocean Networks Canada s deep-water Cascadia Basin site (location: https://www.oceannetworks.ca/sights-sounds/images/maps) using existing scientific drill ship technology. Microsoft's CDR purchase agreement will help us raise the remaining funding and to proceed with a demonstration in 2024 to showcase the permanence, durability and scaleability of such an approach.

Over a short period of time, it is expected that this CO2 will mineralize into carbonates. Directly above the basalt layer is 300m thick cap rock that will act as a natural barrier to prevent the leakage of CO2. Even if the CO2 did escape / leak from this caprock, at the given depth, the temperature and pressure conditions ensure that CO2 is not buoyant compared to the surrounding sea water and will remain at that depth. Having said that, the chances of CO2 leaking are very rare. Hence our removals will be measured directly by the amount of CO2 we have sequestered beneath the basalt
",No,No certification,,N/A,"While all of the CO2 injected into the storage reservoir will remain there, various sources of emissions exist for the life cycle of this project. CO2 capture equipment needs to be manufactured, put in place and maintained, requiring energy and some material resources (e.g. calcite) to extract and capture CO2. In addition, the captured CO2 may need to be temporarily stored and potentially transported to the injection site, unless capture occurs at the injection site and the CO2 is injected directly. At the injection site, an injection hole needs to be drilled and a floating production storage and offloading platform needs to be installed  and maintained. Finally, the injection and monitoring system needs to be powered. The Solid Carbon feasibility project is currently working on a plan to carry out carbon capture at the injection site using sustainable energy, thus minimizing the life cycle emissions.

This risk is very low, as proven by the results of the CarbFix experiment in Iceland. Not only is there a 300- meter, low-permeability sediment layer called  caprock � above the basalt that impedes any CO2 migration to the surface, in the unlikely event that CO2 would leak through the caprock and into the ocean, it would form hydrates and stay on the seaï¬‚oor rather than continue to the surface.

Solid Carbon is currently working with oil and gas service providers; they see the downturn in their markets and recognize the need for new market opportunities for their industry to be sustainable.
 

Regulatory Risk - Carbon dioxide must be listed in Schedule 5 of Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) in order for Solid Carbon to move forward with a demonstration.
 
Ocean Networks Canada is in ongoing conversations with Environment and Climate Change Canada regarding reforms to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA); it is anticipated that the required changes are imminent.",10000000,10000,"The basalt layer where the CO2 is being injected is 3000m+ below sea level. At these depths, CO2 is not buoyant in comparison to the sea water. Also the basalt layer has a 300m thick cap rock above it acting as a protective shell for the CO2. Thanks to these twin protection, the CO2 will remain as it is within the reservoir and gradually dissolve into the pore water. Pore water is naturally moving at 2-3 m/day along the fastest routes of well-connected channels and thus may reach the nearest outcrop over 50 km away in about 50 years but it is expected that most dissolved CO2 will by then have mineralized or taken another route, and whatever escaped will remain near the ocean bottom at over 2500 m below sea level. The only path back into the atmosphere would be through volcanic eruptions that occur some 400 km away which is still highly unlikely. The ocean crust is slowly moving towards it at about 4 cm per year, thus arriving after about 10 million years.","Solid Carbon has developed and is further refining a comprehensive monitoring plan to follow the outcome of the injected CO2. This includes remote sampling through geophysical methods such as seismic and electromagnetic monitoring that indirectly image the CO2 plume in the subsurface, and also direct sampling at monitoring holes capturing pore fluids. Through the use of reactive and non-reactive tracers added to the injection fluids (simulating the outcome of the CO2 left behind by mineralization and also background pore fluids freely flowing through the formation), it will be possible to calculate and thus monitor the mineralization. In addition, the injection hole will be visually monitored by a camera and the surrounding area by acoustic sonar that would detect any escaping gas bubbles.

As the monitoring data will be streaming into the Ocean Networks Canada data archive and will thus be freely and openly accessible to the public through the Oceans 2.0 data portal, the at-a-glance overview Dashboard tool will be utilized to access the current state of the system, how much CO2 is injected, how the plume migrates below the subsurface, how much of it dissolves, mineralizes, and any associated occurrences such as injection-induced small scale seismicity, live view of the injection hole and the bubble-monitoring sonars, all as near-real-time as possible.
","As the risk of reversal is practically solely dependent on the injection system, we will use similar technology as the carbon exploration industry is using for their avoidance of oil and gas spillage. These include leakage detection at all points along the injection line, tracking in- and through-put, and automatic shut-off procedures. Once CO2 arrives at depth, it is deemed safe with no direct route back into the atmosphere.","As any reversal would be immediate (injection line leakage), and all the CO2 entering the reservoir will be durably stored, only this stored CO2 will be accounted for.",N/A,N/A,Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"The ideal outcome from this proposal would be that Microsoft purchases our CDR credits outright so that we can use it to raise the rest of the funds we need for demonstration ranging from federal, provincial and other private sources in Canada and abroad. While we are proposing a demonstration in 2024 of 10000 tons of CO2, based on its success, we project launching ourselves into full-scale operations from 2032 with a capacity of 1.2M tons/year","The price per ton in 2024 will be fixed as it will be a critical part of the funding stack needed to proceed with demonstration in that year. From 2032, since we will be in full-scale operations, the price per ton will vary depending on the volumes committed for purchase.

","The Solid Carbon demonstration off the coast of BC as a pilot project will engage local indigenous and other marine service providers from BC. Successful demonstration, would set the stage for the creation of a whole new BC based Carbon Dioxide Removal industry that could repurpose decommissioned Oil and Gas vessels and equipment and retrain its workforce. With estimated basalt capacity in the Pacific Ocean of over 10000 Gt of CO2, Solid Carbon has the potential to be scaled globally and remove decades worth of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere therefore catering to SDGs 8, 9, 13 and 17. ONC s partnerships enable Indigenous communities to contribute their traditional knowledge and local ocean sensor data to global networks. ONC actively recruit a new generation of Canadian youth, especially girls and Indigenous youth, into ocean science to influence change.","With a deep respect for the Lekwungen peoples upon whose traditional territory ONC s headquarters sit and with networks on many Indigenous lands, we highly regard the importance of Indigenous peoples   relationship to the land and sea. Engaging underrepresented groups in science and engineering, including Indigenous and female students, is an integral part of ONC s mission and supported through several grants. The Solid Carbon team is committed to increasing EDI in the geosciences, the least diverse of all STEM fields, in particular with respect to ethnic and racial diversity.
All research team members are supported by institutions aligned with the principles of the Dimensions Charter,  to foster increased research excellence, innovation, and creativity ¦across all disciplines, through greater EDI. � UBC and UofC are two of the 17 universities of the Dimension s pilot cohort.
ONC knows that diversity underpins excellence. The opportunities to advance our knowledge and understanding of the world together are immense when the barriers to participation are removed. Led by the Solid Carbon Coordinator, the project team will follow a hiring and recruitment framework that ensures the implementation of best practices in EDI across all participating institutions as new Solid Carbon members are recruited from a new generation of Canadian youth, especially girls and Indigenous youth, into ocean science to influence change. ONC staff complement is 40% women and 25% non-white and includes people with disabilities.
ONC has a dedicated Learning and Community Engagement team with already existing networks (e.g. Youth Science Ambassadors in Indigenous Communities) that can be leveraged for recruitment through non-traditional channels. We will also recruit through Pipeline Programs for underrepresented minority and female students. Preferential hiring will be applied for a number of positions to ensure diversity. Ocean Networks Canada (through UVic) offers Indigenous Cultural Acumen Training. Solid Carbon will include this training for all project leads and highly encourage all other collaborators to also be trained.","As proven by the results of the CarbFix experiment in Iceland, the risk of potential environmental harm is exceedingly low. Not only is there a 300-meter, low-permeability sediment layer called  caprock � above the basalt that impedes any CO2

Life Cycle Analysis
Activity: Tons of CO2e Content Per Unit (and Percentage)

Materials: 7.4 (87.0%)
Factory: 0.3 (4.0%)
Shipping: 0.3 (3.9%)
Ocean Ops 0.4 (4.8%)
Management: 0.03 (0.4%)
Total: 8.5 (100%)

Boundaries:
We assessed CO2 emissions per AUP in five categories: materials used, factory production, shipping, marine operations, and management. The primary raw material input is steel, followed by polyester woven fabric and foam. We researched the CO2 emissions per unit (metric ton, square meter, or kilograms, respectively) on the internet, and these factors applied to our usage.  

How set:
We base factory emissions on the annual energy (electricity and natural gas) usage by our prime contractor Reytek LLC in Albuquerque, NM. Shipping assumed rail shipment to Long Beach, CA, and typical CO2 emissions factors. Ocean operations emissions used data from an ABB analysis last December relating to our diesel-powered catamaran workboat deploying 10 AUPâ€™s per trip far offshore. Management emissions used the CO2 emission factor from an internet search.

Omitted emissions:
We omitted the emissions attributable to the silicon coating on the polyester fabric. We omitted emissions attributable to business travel (to the extent not included in the management category).

Why omitted:
We deemed these to be inconsequential.

What would CDR be if included:
The annual CO2 emissions per AUP would have increased by perhaps 0.1 or 0.2 tons, a tiny percentage of the projected gross tons removed.","We are working with Verras Seascape Carbon Initiative for nature-based marine methodologies.

Held taut by a weight, this joins a 1500 m rope back up to the surface where a sea anchor drags the Argo line down-current from the pump, putting the Argo right where the bloom is happening. We will operate these Argos on four cycles per day to give us the best possible information, and all this data will be public in near real-time on the Argo websites in France and the US.

We detect reversals by comparing this data to our baseline BGC Argo outside the array.

If a reversal event were to be detected, our customers would be alerted at the same time we are, given the data is provided in near real-time. We intend to make our data as up-to-date as possible for our customers.  ","We consider the risk of reversal to be minimal because the continuous pumping of nutrients to the sunlit zone triggers new blooms of phytoplankton that absorb respired CO2. 

What happens when phytoplankton blooms are triggered and begin absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean? Over various time periods that CO2 respires - it's just the same as with a tree in the forest - when the tree dies, it falls over and rots, releasing the carbon stored in the tree. The exact process happens with phytoplankton; however, several mechanisms in the ocean are different that cause this carbon to be stored deeper and longer. Here are seven of these unique ocean processes (primary scientist in parentheses).

1. Marine snow, aggregated biomass (Puskaric).
2. Vertical migration (Saba).
3. Salp fecal pellets (Madin).

We have perfected the AUP design, deployment technique, recovery of AUPs, and measurement/verification methodology to achieve a low-cost Artificial Upwelling CDR system. AUPs have a planned life of 80 years, attributable to working physically and biologically in the ocean gyres. 99% of an AUP is submerged underwater, and we've designed the buoy to duck under waves higher than 3 meters - avoiding excessive forces of the harsh ocean environment. On the deployment technique, the flexible tube is spooled up around the buoy and attached to the heavy bottom-weight/valve.

The unspooling is further controlled by paddles on the wings of the buoy and by rotating flaps on the bottom weight. We've innovated a measurement/verification methodology technique to position the BGC ARGO within the plume of nutrients down current from the outlet, ensuring that we get the best measurements of artificial upwelling for carbon dioxide removal. We also provide each AUP with a recovery line to retrieve any AUP that needs service or removal.

In summary, we'll use Microsoft payments to build and deploy our artificial upwelling pumps technology and provide MRV of the resulting ocean CDR. ",10/1/2022,"This project began in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans; Kithil conceived, produced, and tested a wave-driven ocean upwelling pump to cool the upper ocean and reduce hurricane intensity. Seeking insurance industry support, Kithil reached out to its industry organization based in Bermuda, who introduced him to The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). They were seeking technologies to upwell deep nutrient-rich water for CO2 sequestration. They invited Kithil and his team to conduct a 500-foot deep-sea trial onboard their Weatherbird II research vessel to determine if his upwelling pump could deliver nutrients to the sunlit upper ocean and trigger blooms of phytoplankton absorbing CO2. Lead scientists from BIOS included Dr. Rod Johnson and Dr. Mike Lomas. The sea trial demonstrated delivery of colder deep water to the surface within one hour after deployment. Funding for this and subsequent operations came from the sale of Kithilâ€™s previous venture â€œASCIâ€� and its investors. The venture was incorporated as Atmocean, Inc. in 2006.    From then until 2009, Atmocean conducted a series of 500-foot deep-sea trials to gain experience on production, deployment, and recovery of the upwelling pump and gain data on operating parameters. In 2008, the Discovery Channel selected Kithil/Atmocean to assist with its â€œHungry Oceansâ€� program. Kithil initiated contact with Dr. David Karl from the University of Hawaii, who agreed to support a sea trial off of Hawaii. On short notice, in February 2008, Atmocean initiated production of five 0.75 meter diameter, 300-meter depth upwelling pumps, delivered in April to the UH ocean operations location in Honolulu. The trial proceeded, and despite issues with improper assembly, the pumps demonstrated pumping cold deep water.  In 2009 Kithil and a co-worker attended the UNFCCC Copenhagen COP-21 conference, expecting global progress to rein in CO2 emissions, giving attention to the ocean as a sequestration alternative. COP-21 failed to achieve these results, which stopped the market for ocean CO2 removal/offsets.  Atmocean then pivoted to generating electricity from ocean wave energy. Over several years of development funded by its investors and from Oregon Wave Energy Trust, it came to understand this was feasible but very high cost. A further pivot to desalination and onshore aquaculture met the same roadblocks â€“ possible but not economic and therefore no viable market.  By 2018 â€“ with CO2 exceeding 400ppm - it became apparent the original application of ocean carbon dioxide removal would again gain attention and restart the market for ocean CDR. To entice further support from its two remaining investors, Atmocean spun out the new entity â€œOcean-based Climate Solutions, Inc.â€� and redesigned the original 2008 wave-driven upwelling pump for 80+ year durability as well as production and deployment efficiency and low cost. This interim period from 2005-2018 also saw technical advances in ocean biogeochemistry measurements by the BGC ARGO profiling float program. The latest commercial version now offers six sensors enabling accurate daily measurement of ocean CO2.   During this period, Atmocean was fortunate to retain the unique engineering capabilities of Philip Fullam. He designed, produced, deployed, and assisted with measuring the outcomes from over 100 days of wave-driven upwelling trials and wave tank tests at Plymouth University (UK) and Texas A&M.    In 2009, marine biologist Chris White provided critical on-the-ground logistical services. His support ranged from obtaining a testing permit from the Peruvian Navy, overseeing all operations in the remote fishing village of Ilo, Peru, to conducting a sea trial at the College of North Atlantic (Newfoundland) wave energy test site. Another critical resource has been the NM Small Business Assistance (SBA) Program at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The SBA program provided us with no-cost state-of-the-art technical expertise and modeling from their staff scientists and engineers, which otherwise we could not have afforded.  From 2006 to 2021, Atmocean/OBCS received over a dozen grants, including a current active grant to model the inclination angles of a tethered biogeochemical ARGO and the lateral forces imposed by ambient currents on a 1.9-meter diameter by 500-meter deep AUP now proposed to Microsoft and other potential corporate clients.

The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is the most durable ocean region for carbon storage achieving 300+ years in some areas. ","We monitor carbon sequestration using one tethered Biogeochemical-Argo profiling float (BGC Argo) per 10 AUPs with a long rope that extends 500m below the bottom of the 500m pump. Held taut by a weight, this joins a 1500 m rope back up to the surface where a sea anchor drags the Argo line down-current from the pump, putting the Argo right where the bloom is happening. We will operate these Argos on four cycles per day to give us the best possible information, and all this data will be public in near real-time on the Argo websites in France and the US.

We detect reversals by comparing this data to our baseline BGC Argo outside the array.

If a reversal event were to be detected, our customers would be alerted at the same time we are, given the data is provided in near real-time. We intend to make our data as up-to-date as possible for our customers.  ","We consider the risk of reversal to be minimal because the continuous pumping of nutrients to the sunlit zone triggers new blooms of phytoplankton that absorb respired CO2. 

What happens when phytoplankton blooms are triggered and begin absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean? Over various time periods that CO2 respires - it's just the same as with a tree in the forest - when the tree dies, it falls over and rots, releasing the carbon stored in the tree. The exact process happens with phytoplankton; however, several mechanisms in the ocean are different that cause this carbon to be stored deeper and longer. Here are seven of these unique ocean processes (primary scientist in parentheses).

1. Marine snow, aggregated biomass (Puskaric).
2. Vertical migration (Saba).
3. Salp fecal pellets (Madin).

","We monitor carbon sequestration using one tethered Biogeochemical-Argo profiling float (BGC Argo) per 10 AUPs with a long rope that extends 500m below the bottom of the 500m pump. Held taut by a weight, this joins a 1500 m rope back up to the surface where a sea anchor drags the Argo line down-current from the pump, putting the Argo right where the bloom is happening. We will operate these Argos on four cycles per day to give us the best possible information, and all this data will be public in near real-time on the Argo websites in France and the US.

We detect reversals by comparing this data to our baseline BGC Argo outside the array.

If a reversal event were to be detected, our customers would be alerted at the same time we are, given the data is provided in near real-time. We intend to make our data as up-to-date as possible for our customers. 
","We consider the risk of reversal to be minimal because the continuous pumping of nutrients to the sunlit zone triggers new blooms of phytoplankton that absorb respired CO2. 

What happens when phytoplankton blooms are triggered and begin absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean? Over various time periods that CO2 respires - it's just the same as with a tree in the forest - when the tree dies, it falls over and rots, releasing the carbon stored in the tree. The exact process happens with phytoplankton; however, several mechanisms in the ocean are different that cause this carbon to be stored deeper and longer. Here are seven of these unique ocean processes (primary scientist in parentheses).

1. Marine snow, aggregated biomass (Puskaric).
2. Vertical migration (Saba).
3. Salp fecal pellets (Madin).
4. Diatoms and other heavy plankton (Chai).
5. Recalcitrant DOC, which resists remineralization as it sinks (Jiao).
6. Mixed layer pump (Gardner).
7. Particle injection pump (Boyd).","Our new pricing methodology is based on tons per pump without specifying a precise time period, so it automatically compensates for short or over tons.",Not applicable,Not applicable,Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"Our ideal outcome is for Microsoft to contract for our minimum order of 10 AUPâ€™s in 2022 (FY2023). Our preferred minimum contract is 3 years. 

Our minimum annual volume is 10 pumps removing 2,500 tons per year.  Our maximum annual volume is the Pumps deployed which equals 6,000,000 tons per year (100% of Microsoftâ€™s target).

Relative to tenure, we wish to emphasize that our AUPâ€™s operate for up to 80 years with minimal added cost once deployed.  Our potential maximum tenure is 80 years.

Regarding the contract lead time, our production and deployment lead time are now approximately 10 months; therefore, Microsoftâ€™s commitment should come no later than 1/1/2022 for CDR tons beginning 10/1/2022.
","Our delivery terms have changed from our 2020 and 2021 Microsoft CDR submissions.  We now base our terms on CDR tons removed, whereas previously, we based our terms on AUPs built and deployed (2020); and on tons per year (2021). Our price per ton is now quoted, so we recover all our costs when the first committed tons are achieved. Then we reduce the price in line with the much-reduced costs each future year.",,,,,The available supply of the BGC-ARGO is restricted near-term but we expect this advanced measurement technology will become more widely available later next year and beyond.,"Our project is an innovative application of original science published in 2008 by Professor Dave Karl, University of Hawaii, and Professor Ricardo Letelier, Oregon State. They found that upwelling seawater from below 300 meters in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii delivers additional nutrients to support multiple phytoplankton blooms drawing down more CO2 than is upwelled. While this study remains the pivotal scientific study of how ocean CDR using AUP's will work, recent research by Prof. Ulf Riebesell at GEOMAR has found even more potential for ocean CDR. 

We have perfected the AUP design, deployment technique, recovery of AUPs, and measurement/verification methodology to achieve a low-cost Artificial Upwelling CDR system. AUPs have a planned life of 80 years, attributable to working physically and biologically in the ocean gyres. 99% of an AUP is submerged underwater, and we've designed the buoy to duck under waves higher than 3 meters - avoiding excessive forces of the harsh ocean environment. On the deployment technique, the flexible tube is spooled up around the buoy and attached to the heavy bottom-weight/valve.  As the heavy bottom-weight sinks, this unspools the fabric and fills the tube with seawater. The unspooling is further controlled by paddles on the wings of the buoy and by rotating flaps on the bottom weight. We've innovated a measurement/verification methodology technique to position the BGC ARGO within the plume of nutrients down current from the outlet, ensuring that we get the best measurements of artificial upwelling for carbon dioxide removal. We also provide each AUP with a recovery line to retrieve any AUP that needs service or removal.

In combination, by leveraging natural biological processes (phytoplankton which doubles in mass every 24 hours), these numerous innovations described above make ocean carbon dioxide removal using AUPs practical, economical, and scalable to put a big dent in climate change. ","Here is a list of our ocean CDR co-benefits:

Ocean Ecosystem: Phytoplankton form the base of the ocean food chain - supporting more fish, marine mammals, and avian species.
Food Security Enhancement: AUPs increase wild fish stocks. A critical need in todayâ€™s overfished oceans.
Oxygen: Phytoplankton are photosynthesizers â€“ emitting oxygen while absorbing CO2 â€“ helping re-oxygenate the adjacent ocean.
Temperature: Cools the upper mixed layer.
Jobs: Our solution will create an entirely new industry both onshore and offshore.
Scientific Data: Dramatically expands the biogeochemical ARGO float network, providing massive high-resolution data to improve scientific knowledge of ocean physical and biological/chemical processes. 

How we plan to measure the co-benefits:

On Ocean Ecosystem, including wild-fish stocks, Oxygen, and Temperature: We plan to measure the ocean ecosystem continuously with BGC ARGOs. During scheduled maintenance, we will obtain photographic evidence to the extent practical for getting qualitative data. 

On Jobs: We plan to provide data on employment, income, and economic multiplier benefits from the production (onshore) and deployment (offshore) of AUPs. 

On Scientific Data: We plan to use BGC ARGOs to expand their network. Their data is publicly available in near real-time - the information is quality controlled by CLS France & the US ARGO HQ. Quantitative results from BGC ARGO are outlined in this table (right) from https://biogeochemical-ARGO.org/scientific-questions-general-context.php 

On Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 1. No Poverty: This initial project is just a starting point and can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact on this SDG.

SDG 2. Zero Hunger: By 2040, with only 20 AUPs, we will replenish the ocean with approx. Fourteen million servings of fish, at 100 grams per serving. Our technology aids in adding to the ocean food supply, which contributes to food security.

SDG 3. Good Health and Well-being: This initial project is just a starting point and can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact on this SDG.

SDG 4. Quality Education: This initial project is just a starting point and can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact on this SDG.

SDG 8. Decent work and economic growth: This initial project is just a starting point and can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact on this SDG. Most notably in port cities where our factories would be near or located.

SDG 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: AUPs start a new industry on combating climate & making our oceans healthy.  

SDG 10. Reduced inequalities: This initial project is just a starting point and can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact on this SDG.

SDG 11. Sustainable cities and communities: n/a

SDG 12. Responsible consumption and production: this initial project is just a starting point and can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact on this SDG. AUPs contribute to the replenishment of fish stocks; on the order of 1.5% of phytoplankton grown, the ocean is replenished with wild fish (trophic level 3).

SDG 13. Climate action: This initial project is just a starting point and can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact on this SDG. We can scale into the millions and avert the worst of climate change. Our hope is Microsoft becomes a catalyst in this effort that will bring our technology to the attention of other public corporations and world governments. This project will kickstart the effort to remove CO2 and scale back atmospheric PPM towards 300ppm by 2100. There are numerous benefits to restoring a stable climate - less unbearable summer heat as presently experienced in the western USA, mitigation of sea-level rise, floods in Germany, etc.

SDG 14. Life below water: This initial project is just a starting point and can be scaled up to make a meaningful impact on this SDG. AUPs contribute to the replenishment of wild fish stocks; on the order of 1.5% of phytoplankton grown.

SDG 15. Life on land: n/a

SDG 16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions: n/a

SDG 17. Partnership for the Goals: n/a
","Once upon a time, artificial upwelling was just a methodology for enhancing nearshore fish production.  However, recent advances in measuring ocean biogeochemistry have made it possible to measure its powerful ability to draw down CO2.  With BGC Argo profiling floats (paired with OTEC Batteries), we can measure co-benefits such as the health of ocean ecosystems, food security enhancement via wild fish stocks, and oxygen and temperature levels near the AUP. We can remotely sample multiple times per day the ocean biogeochemistry from 1000 meters depth to the surface and deliver that data to our customers, providing total transparency.",,,,,,
Olive Gaea,No,The International Small Group and Tree Planting Program,OG_TIST,Forestry (removal only),,,Afforestation,"The International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST) is a combined reforestation and
sustainable development project, in Uganda, carried out by subsistence farmers. The farmers
plant trees on their land and retain ownership of the trees and their products. They receive
training from TIST and a share of the carbon revenues from CAAC.
TIST empowers Small Groups of 6-to-12 subsistence farmers in India, Kenya, Tanzania, and
Uganda to combat the devastating effects of deforestation, poverty and drought. Combining
sustainable development with carbon sequestration, TIST already supports the reforestation and
biodiversity efforts of over 65,000 subsistence farmers. Carbon credit sales generate participant
income and provide project funding to address agricultural, HIV/AIDS, nutritional and fuel
challenges. As TIST expands to more groups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more
biodiversity, more climate change benefit and more income for more people.
The TIST Uganda project will achieve GHG removals through reforestation/revegetation and
sequester atmospheric CO2 in live aboveground and belowground biomass.
TIST project areas are located on lands owned or controlled by TIST small hold farmers and that
have been used as cropland or grassland. Because the farmers also own the trees that they
plant, the species are selected by the Small Groups, based on their needs and the benefits,
which they desire to obtain.

The key highlights from the TIST project in 4 countries is as below:
âœ”	110,000 Farmers in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, and India 
âœ”	49,000 Hectares of degraded land restored.
âœ”	21+ Million trees alive and monitored today, which has resulted in 7.8+ million tonnes of sequestered carbon to date. 
âœ”	Over 16,000 Small Groups have raised over 21,000,000 trees in the last 20 years. 
âœ”	16+ Project Designs (PD) Verified VCS, CCBA Gold for exceptional benefits (co-benefits).

Farmers collect seeds, plant trees, maintain groves, monitor results, and receive 70% revenue share from the sale of dual-validated and verified carbon credits
As the trees grow, carbon captured is quantified and verified and certified greenhouse gas credits are sold in the global carbon market. TIST Farmers receive annual carbon pre-payments for each tree established and 70% of the net profit when credits are sold.
Smallholder farmers also derive significant non-carbon related benefits verified to exceed $8 per tree. Trees provide fruit, fodder, fuel, windbreaks, shade and stabilize riverbanks plus participants have access to health information and training and safe cooking stoves.

Clean Air Action and the TIST Program have won numerous awards over the years for their climate leadership and innovative approach towards running the community managed tree plantation program across 4 geographies. TIST Co-Founders Ben & Vannesa Henneke received the William K. Reilly Award for Environmental Leadership in 2017. Clean Air Action Corporation won Environmental Finance's ""Best Project Developer"" in Forestry and Land Use in 2016. TIST won Environmental Finance's ""Best Offsetting Project"" in 2016. TIST won Environmental Finance's ""Best Offsetting Project"" in 2014. TIST received a Computerworld Honors Program 2007 Laureate for its monitoring system. TIST has 14 successful Validated and Verified Projects under the VCS and CCB Standards  ","In 1998, Bishop Simon Chiwanga had a challenge; dealing with tens of thousands of parishioners spread over large distances, he needed a better way to organize his diocese, the Diocese of Mpwapwa, Tanzania. Thinking outside the box, he invited a team of missionaries, led by Ben and Vannesa Henneke of the Truro Anglican Church in Fairfax, Virginia, to lead seminars on the formation and organization of Small Groups. These groups, comprised of 6-12 people, would engage in Bible study, support, and planning. Small Groups discerned and implemented certain Best Practices, such as rotating leadership, Kujengana, collaboration, and servant leadership. Although they didn t know it at the time, the structure of Small Groups and Best Practices would be shaped by the needs and desires of its members into The International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST).

The following year, a second mission trip continued the facilitation of Small Group seminars. In these seminars, participants were asked to think about the type of world they envisioned for themselves and their children. Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income of $280, and Mpwapwa is one of the country s poorest regions. Adult life expectancy is 52 years, with approximately one in three young adults testing HIV positive. Literacy rates are approximately 80% for men and 57% for women. Compounding these challenges,  slash and burn � subsistence farming had led to erosion, decreasing crop yields, widespread deforestation, and famine. Participants, who were almost exclusively subsistence farmers, identified specific needs such as reforestation, sustainable agriculture, poverty reduction, and the elimination of famine. They further identified planting trees, HIV/AIDS education, and Conservation Farming, as strategies for addressing these needs.

In December of 1999, 40 participants in the diocese of Mpwapwa and Clean Air Action Corporation (CAAC) built upon several ideas including Small Groups, the sharing of Best Practices, and the need for reforestation, to develop the initial TIST program. Through tree planting, education, and collaboration, Small Groups were able to directly respond to the needs professed by their members. The goals of this program were: conservation agricultural management, food security, basic business management, and the creation of a virtual cash crop through carbon sequestration.

In the coming year, TIST spread to 40 new Small Groups. By training new trainers and relying on word of mouth, TIST was able to begin a sustainable model of viral, organic growth. By the end of 2001, the word had spread with over 600 more Small Groups joining the program. Additional Small Group training in tree planting, nursery care, seedling care, public health, and Conservation Farming further leveraged the passion and work of Small Group members.

Expansion into Kenya, Uganda, and India

In 2001, CAAC staff visited India for an employee s wedding. Seeing widespread drought and deforestation, they identified an opportunity for TIST to help. They held seminars and found receptive farmers eager to implement the program. As villages began planting trees, India and Tanzania started an information-sharing program to provide insight and encouragement. The success of India s program demonstrated to CAAC that TIST could work outside of Tanzania.

In July of 2003, CAAC organized a conference in Morogoro, Tanzania, that fundamentally altered the trajectory of TIST s progress. The seminar drew on the experience of Tanzanian and Indian participants to offer training and knowledge-sharing to Ugandan farmers. Overcoming initial skepticism, the participants took the program back to Uganda and were met with overwhelming enthusiasm. The Morogoro Seminar was one of the first examples of  Come and See �, wherein new participants are invited to come and witness the potential of TIST firsthand. This strategy has been used ever since. Following the Morogoro Seminar, TIST in Uganda began to experience viral growth, as the program spread to new villages and towns.

TIST s expansion into Kenya was facilitated by a partnership with USAID that provided the resources to implement the current program, as well as the opportunity to significantly expand the social and sustainable development components. CAAC continued the practice of cross-country information sharing by bringing Tanzanian participants into the Mount Kenya region to train and spread the Best Practices, as well as bringing Tanzanians to Kenya for Come and See. In the following year, TIST s program in Kenya exploded. During this time, several currently integral components of TIST were developed. The TIST Values of honesty, accuracy, transparency, mutual accountability, service to one another, and small budget/big results were formally articulated. These values were vetted by other countries  participants and came to undergird the entire program.

In order to administer to rapid geographic and participant growth, TIST implemented a new system in Kenya called  Clusters �. Clusters were designed to provide services such as training, administration, payment, and newsletter distribution, to Small Groups living within walking distance of one another. Cluster organization borrowed previous TIST practices, including rotating leadership and the policy of  one man, one woman �. This operational unit has become one of TIST s defining features and a huge part of the program s success. By the end of 2006, TIST was operating in four countries, with over 20,000 members in 2,800 Small Groups.

Growth

TIST has celebrated many milestones and organizational successes. In 2011, TIST was the first program in the world to receive dual validation and verification from VCS (Verified Carbon Standard) and CCB (Climate, Community & Biodiversity) for its carbon sequestration work. This unmatched endorsement of TIST s data management, community benefits, transparency, and efficacy has set the program apart in the realms of carbon offsetting and social development.

While TIST celebrated its  first in the world � status, it also marked the ten-year anniversary of the program expansion in India. Two years later, a large celebration in Uganda marked their decade of growth, with Kenya following in 2015. As the programs evolved, new strategies were developed and implemented to support the work of the TIST farmers. Leadership Councils, comprised of excelling program participants, were formed to provide feedback and take on decision-making responsibilities at the local level. They quickly became a critical place for identifying talent and leadership among program participants. Using such strategies, TIST has created self-sustaining in-country capacity, with leadership and expertise provided by participants themselves.

Always an important part of TIST, information-sharing strategies have worked to allow the program to grow and refine itself organically. The Small Group is the building block of these strategies, wherein individuals share things that worked and did not work, with people in similar situations. Clusters allow for information sharing on a larger level, followed by groups of Clusters, and finally inter-country trips and exchanges of information. These various levels of exchange have facilitated viral growth and constant distillation of effective practices on every level of the organization.

Over the past decade, TIST has experienced massive growth, in terms of participants, Small Groups, Clusters, trees planted, and hectares of reforested land. From 2006-2017, membership approximately quadrupled. Today, there are approximately 19 million live trees planted as the result of over 90,000 TIST participants  work. The value of this work is comprised not only of the carbon sequestration and corresponding carbon offsetting products, but also in the massive production of ancillary benefits that farmers experience through TIST including: fruit, fodder, fuel, windbreak, leadership development, HIV/AIDS education, general health information, clean stove construction, and social network creation.",1/1/2006,Kabale,Kabale,Uganda,35000,37000,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,100,100,The project is pure carbon removal project and does not include carbon credits from emission reduction.,Yes,Verra (VCS),,"Verra, Project ID 994",,,Yes,,"1.

3. Extreme Weather",50,50,"CAAC has GhG contracts with each Small Group in the PD wherein each member has formally committed for 50 years not to cut down their trees, except when implementing best practices (such as to improve growth) for agro-forestry developed by TIST. No commercial harvest or clear cutting is permitted. Fuel wood is only to be gathered as dead wood or debris resulting from pruning and thinning. Thinning is allowed (i.e. it is not considered ""harvest"" in the context of the VCS Non-permanence tool) and is an acceptable forest practice used to improve the growth and health of surviving trees. While thinning may cause a dip in carbon stocks at a specific PA, the numerous project areas, different planting schedule and different species means that there should not be a dip in overall carbon stocks. The management and financial plan is for TIST to continue well beyond the crediting period, at least until the 50 year term of the contract is achieved. First, if available, we will try to extend the PD for another crediting period. This will be based on whatever rules Verra has in place at the end of the crediting period. Second, this PD is a subset of TIST. TIST currently has 14 PD, has two more that are in the pipeline and continues to grow every year based on internal financing. Even without adding another crediting period, and assuming there is a carbon market, TIST is expected to add 800,000 to 1MM new trees every year. Based on the financial plan,6 TIST can maintain the current PDs and expansion beyond the 2053, thought the sale of carbon credits. This is true even if the crediting periods of the current PDs are not extended. The third point relates to the benefits we provide the farmers. They will continue to receive their carbon payments and the sustainable development benefits from participation in TIST. As demonstrated in the CCB monitoring reports, the SD benefits are much greater than the carbon. They will also have the opportunity for continued training at Cluster meetings.

 ¢ The project areas are widely dispersed over thousands of square kilometers.  ¢ The project areas are dispersed in different ecosystems. 
 ¢ Many of the project areas are bordered by roads which serve as fire breaks. 
 ¢ Many of the farmers live in the project areas and will be able to react early in any fire situation. 
 ¢ Most of the project areas are also used for farming so the overall stem density is often relatively low.  ¢ Members are allowed to collect deadwood, prune and thin, reducing fuel loads and lifting the canopy away from the ground.  ¢ TIST GhG contracts require all trees will continue to be monitored and replanted for 20 years in the case of any mortality.

the TIST groups and the availability of wood, shade, lumber, fruit, and improved crop yields
provides the entire community with positive examples.

Climate Resilience: 
 ¢ The TIST program improves resource sustainability and reduces resource degradation.
Because TIST participants plant trees, and because not all trees survive, the deadfall alone
will reduce the need for participants to continue to cut down trees outside TIST project
boundaries after just a few years. Once enough trees are planted, they have the potential to
provide a sustainable fuel wood supply.
 ¢ Resource degradation exists when soils erode. TIST trees directly stabilize soils. They also
provide shade that enables grasses to grow under the canopy, which further reduces soil
degradation. They produce fruit, nuts, and traditional medicines, which lessen the pressure
to obtain these from non-TIST tree stocks.
 ¢ By empowering Small Groups to select which tree species to plant and training on benefits of
indigenous species, the project reinforces biodiversity friendliness.
 ¢ The impact of TIST is to reduce the levels of pollution in general. TIST provides an
improvement in air quality through the sequestration of carbon. Soil stabilization that results
from TIST also has the ability to improve water quality over the long-term. TIST does not
own a fossil-fueled vehicle.

Olive Gaea,No,"Protecting 500,000 hectares of forest and mangroves in Colombia",OG_PFC,Forestry (removal only),,,Improved Forest Management,"The Pacific Forest Communities project aims to protect 500,000 hectares of forest and mangroves on Colombia's pacific coast, while providing clean water, scholarships, and health centres to more than 60,000 people from rural Afro- and indigenous communities. The project objectives are threefold: 

(i) to mitigate climate change by reducing deforestation and forest degradation, and recuperation of already degraded forest lands; 
(ii) contribute to biodiversity conservation
including High Conservation Values, and, 
(iii) foster sustainable development of local communities.

Located in the collective territories of Bajo Calima and La Plata-Baha­a Ma¡laga in the Pacific coastal municipality of Buenaventura, the forests in the project area are important nationally and internationally for the ecosystem services they provide, yet they have experienced a continued reduction in biomass due largely to illegal logging. Following from the gradual degradation of forests caused by continual timber extraction, many forest areas are ultimately converted to agriculture and pasture. The project aims to alleviate these pressures on the forests through the support of governance capacity, the generation of alternative economic activities and income sources, and through capacity building in administration and management. These project activities, beyond protecting local forests and biodiversity, contribute to social and economic development in one of the poorest areas of Colombia. 
Characterized by a variety of ecosystems from tropical rainforests to coastal mangroves and wetlands, Colombia s Pacific coast has incredible native biodiversity. PFC activities to reduce deforestation and degradation will improve and restore biodiversity, enabling forests to return to an approximately natural state within 15 years. Unique animal species, vegetation, and threatened ecosystems create high conservation values throughout the terrain.
More than 8,000 families and 40,000 people, including 20 Afro-Colombian community councils and indigenous councils, are benefiting from PFC work to strengthen local institutions, build governance capacity, and improve the equitable distribution of benefits and the preservation of cultural values. The projects are also providing healthcare, education, clean water, sanitation, and alternative livelihoods, including eco-tourism and sustainable commodities such as acai, cocoa, and coconut. The project is estimated to generate approximately 13,031,611 VCUs over 30 years.","From initial project development through project validation in 2017, BIOREDD+ was the project developer.

Fondo Accia³n has a solid track record in financial administration, program management and conservation finance, which includes the creation and management of endowments, sinking and revolving funds and the design of innovative financial mechanisms for conservation.The Fondo Accia³n team has proven capacity as part of the implementation team for another Gold certified CCBA and VCS registered project in Colombia. In a similar setting, on the Colombian Bio-geographical Choco Region, and with community owned lands, Fondo Accia³n has been leading the community engagement, coaching and socialization processes. With enough financial and administrative capacity, the Fund has the required institutional and human resources to perform as a financial mechanism for the BCBM REDD+ project. Its strengths are related to community engagement, governance strengthening and institutional development, for which Fondo Accia³n has
a good group of qualified staff, and ISO certified procedures and protocols.
Carbon monitoring and biodiversity assessment will be done through outsourced contracts with fully capable institutions based in Colombia. Fondo Accia³n has already been involved in the first assessments related to the first verification in the other REDD+ project in Colombia.

Key technical skills were provided by ecoPartners LLC with regards to the monitoring and quantification of project GHG emissions reductions. ecoPartners LLC is a forestry-based company that works with project developers, forest owners and verification bodies to build successful carbon offset projects. ecoPartners possesses expertise in the technical aspects of project design, planning and development including biometrics, accounting methodologies and remote sensing. ecoPartners has extensive experience validating and verifying projects under multiple carbon standards, including both VCS and CCB. During this monitoring period, ecoPartners has provided technical input with remote sensing, land use change analysis and project documentation as well as guidance support through verification. This included the development of an inventory protocol and the necessary training of local people to carry out this inventory in collaboration with WWC. This contributed, alongside the LiDAR analysis, to updating carbon stocks for degraded areas. This involvement ensures that the carbon quantification was completed using the most up to date data and measurement techniques. The implementation partners and its partners are well- qualified within their respective fields and capably fulfilled the technical requirements needed to complete project implementation and monitoring. This has allowed for successful project implementation fulfilling all VCS and CCB rules and requirements. 

Stand For Trees is a program of the US non-profit Code REDD","The project start date is 08/26/2013. This is the date that a letter of intent with OPTIM was signed to reduce emissions through a REDD+ project. Because communities within the same project signed letters on different dates, the most recent date is used as the official project start. This approach to the start date is based on the financial viability of the project. The signed letters of intent document formalized a number of forest governance actions that were also signed by community leaders. 
The project will have 2 main phases:
- Phase I (1-7 years), to undertake most of the governance oriented activities, complete business plans, set SPVs for productive activities, and provide technical assistance to farmers. During this phase, the community councils will work on their land use plans, capacity building, set-up of patrolling bodies, conservation areas demarcation, and internal agreements for benefit distribution. Also, it will be used to allow for implementation of productive activities, revenue sharing, and re-investment agreements. This phase will consolidate the REDD+ project activities with the communities, and will help build capacity for MRV.
- Phase 2 (8-30 years), to continue with the implementation of the project activities. Years11 and 21 will be used to re-assess the baseline situation regarding carbon, deforestation and degradation drivers, and project activities, and to define needs for readjustment. Land use plans and progress will be assessed and discussed at the assembly level.

Since the project s inception, local communities have been actively participating in the project s formulation and implementation. The early involvement of participating communities has created awareness among community members and readiness for project implementation. Community support has culminated in the project s endorsement by the legal representatives of communities and the communities  General Assembly. These endorsements demonstrate the communities  long-term commitment to emissions reductions from avoided logging and deforestation.

As the main implementing partner of the project, Fondo Accia³n s original Investment Plan for 2017-2020 contemplated the implementation of $14.6 million in projects and $1.9 million in operation (all funding sources), for a total budget of $16.5 million (annual average $4.1 million). Because of successful fundraising during 2017 and 2018, the budget has increased by $15.8 million to $32.4 million (annual average $8.1 million).",8/26/2013,Buenaventura,Buenaventura,Colombia,25000,30000,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,100,100,"Project, baseline and leakage emissions were estimated by parameterizing the VM0006 equations EQ107-EQ113 in a new form that is equivalent to EQ106, though these values are never directly applied in accounting. Rather in accounting EQ107-EQ113 are applied to determine NERs per EQ106.
The ex-ante Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) are calculated by adjusting the estimated NERs by the buffer allocation.  Ex-post project emissions for this verification period were calculated by summing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation transitions observed during this monitoring period. Per Section 5.4 of the PD, all project activities are meant to reduce these two emissions types. 
Plot-based measurements within the LULC class and/or forest stratum were used to calibrate and validate remote sensing sampling unit data (RSSU) and carbon pool measurements. The VM0006 methodology was followed in allocating plots and biomass values within LULC classes. The LULC class of each specific biomass plot was determined using the LULC map closest in time to the time of measurement. Since degradation was included, biomass inventory plots in the forest area were assigned the appropriate forest stratum or LULC class using the forest stratification model and map developed for this project. Several plots were sampled for each LULC class, and no plots were measured multiple times: instead multiple plots within each LULC class were used to calculate the mean and variance of biomass. 
Emissions from leakage are quantified in two approaches for the purposes of ex-ante estimates. First, leakage is quantified by defining a leakage area and adjusting baseline rates of deforestation and degradation in the leakage area using leakage cancellation rates. And second, by making reasonable assumptions about the proportion of merchantable biomass in the project region based on the results of the timber study to apply a conservative market-effects leakage discount. 
For the purposes of ex-post estimates, the leakage area is monitored for increases in deforestation and degradation relative to predicted baseline levels. The market-effects discount factor is applied until the time of baseline reassessment.

Specifically, the VCS project crediting period is 30 years, starting in 2013 and ending in 2043. The VCS project lifetime is also 30 years, the period of time during which the project proponents and implementing partners are committed to maintain the following activities that will protect previously issued credits. While the management plans, including the Implementation Plan, extend in some instances out to 60 years, the implementation of the project activities will occur during the 30 years of the project lifetime. However, the project benefits are expected to last far beyond this time frame. The project is taking measures to enhance the climate, community, and biodiversity benefits of the project beyond the project crediting period by implementing the following long-term activities throughout the project lifetime:
â—�	Continuing to strengthen land tenure and forest governance. The communities will update internal by-laws every 10 years, taking into account requirements of the REDD+ project.
â—�	Continuing to develop and implement sustainable forest and land use management plans. The communities will continue to assess and update forest management plans, based on current priorities for sustainable land use.
â—�	Developing alternative livelihoods. The communities will continue to increase household incomes, reducing the need for income from timber extraction, through the production, processing and marketing of cocoa, acai and Chontaduro.
In addition to the above-mentioned activities, the project implementers are establishing a benefits distribution mechanism that will provide net income to participating communities to create and maintain the social investments identified by the communities. The benefits from these investments will improve livelihoods long beyond the life of the project.","Emissions from leakage are quantified in two approaches for the purposes of ex-ante estimates.

","The project was designed and has been developed in such a way that all of the risks identified via a participatory process with community members have been managed and/or mitigated against during the monitoring period. Specifically, members of the community evaluated the possibility of natural risks, such as: the occurrence of fire, pestilence, climate and geological risks, the results of which are reflected in the Non Permanence Risk tool. As was done at time of validation, the project communities found that the risks posed from fire, pest and disease outbreaks, extreme weather, and geologic events were insignificant. Data from the DesInventar system once more shows no reports of forest fires, significant pest or disease outbreaks, or significant seismic events within the region. While flooding is a form of extreme weather event that does occur naturally within the region with a frequency of less than 10 years, it poses a negligible risk to carbon stocks, as floods affect annual crops rather than forests, as demonstrated in the DesInventar data. Further, the protection of natural forests from deforestation and degradation will reduce the impact of flooding events as a result of forest ecosystem services. Thus, no actions were further required to mitigate these risks.","The buyer is buying REDD+ credits that have already delivered sequestration so there is no risk of 'failing to sequester', and therefore no reversal compensation is needed.",Buffer pool composition is as per the Verra Pooled buffer account for similar AFOLU projects.,14%,"FY22 sale only (July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022)",,,"LiDAR surveying was performed via aircraft to capture higher resolution data for areas of degraded forests within the project and leakage area boundaries. In order to ensure unbiased sampling of degraded areas, a random flight path was allocated for the project. Detailed specifications were compiled and provided to the LIDAR contractor to ensure the quality of the obtained LIDAR data was in alignment with the original LIDAR data collected and processed at validation. Checks were made with the LIDAR contractor that these specifications could be met before any data collection occurred. After data collection, the data products provided by the contractor were checked against the list of specifications to ensure their compliance. The results of the LiDAR data were analyzed using the original biomass expansion models developed during validation by GeoEcoMap Inc. The carbon stock estimates in degraded areas derived from the application of these models were used to observe any potential state change in these dynamic forest areas. In addition to the collection of LiDAR data in degraded forest areas, a biomass inventory was also completed within areas classified as degraded forest during the 2012 LULC classification to confirm any changes in biomass or carbon stocks.

Social: Uplifts the forest-dwelling communities of the Colombian Pacific through training and technical assistance in agriculture, fisheries, and ecotourism, and has created new jobs in forest patrolling and scientific research. The project also brings community members clean water, new health centres, and scholarships. 

Biodiversity: From mangroves and lowland forest to highland forests and mountains, Colombia is one of the world s 12 megadiverse countries and home to about 10% of the world s animal and plant species. The protection of its rich Pacific coast and native forests through this project is key for the survival for countless diverse species.  

The project activities have been designed to transform impoverished communities that rely heavily on logging as a source of income to thriving communities that derive economic benefits from alternative activities.

Positive Co-benefits:
- Human, through better health indicators (morbidity and mortality), resulting in a better provision of basic health care, drinking water, and sanitation;
- Social, strengthening the governance capacity of the territories; organizing for the procurement and distribution of inputs and benefits resulting from the project; and controlling forest degradation and deforestation;
- Natural, through the development and improvement of crops, and improvement of degraded forest areas through conservation efforts;
- Physical, through the improvement or creation of structures and capacity needed to add value to supply chains; and
- Financial, through assurance of capital flows from profitable productive activities, sale of carbon credits, and productive investment of public or private capital.

The project supports the following UN SDGs: 
â—� 1 - Eradicating poverty: Generation of employment alternatives and opportunities in environmental services and green business markets. Linking the community to patrolling programs of their territory and administrative activities. New sources of temporary employment were implemented and new forms of providing services are provided within the framework of REDD + projects.
â—� 2 - End Hunger: Sustainable agricultural practices have been promoted with community producers, and community participants have been given equal access to technologies to improve production and how to reach better markets. 
â—� 4 - Quality Education: The connected landscapes program implemented the strategy,  Conservar Educando � during this reporting period, which through different workshops, trainings and events, improved knowledge about the environment, and sustainable, friendly production. It is expected that with the potential income from the sale of carbon credits, contributions will be made to elements of educational infrastructure, internet connectivity and virtual courses with the National Learning Service (SENA).
â—� 5 - Gender Equality - The participation of women in decisionmaking and in the different councils and workshops has been favorable and their participation has been in accordance with the implementation of Fondo Accia³n s policies, especially the one related to gender.
â—� 8 - Decent Work and economic growth: The REDD + project has allowed access to all community members to improve their technical capabilities through service contract positions to develop activities for the project. All the contracts have been adjusted to comply with Colombian regulations, recognizing all labor, social and occupational health rights.
â—� 13 - Climate Action: This objective is met through the reduction of deforestation and degradation in the humid forests of the Colombian Pacific, under the mechanisms of REDD + projects validated and in the process of verification, such as this one.","The project is mitigating climate change by reducing deforestation and forest degradation, and natural recuperation of already degraded forest lands, while contributing to biodiversity conservation including High Conservation Values. More than that it is fostering sustainable development of local communities providing them education and employment opportunities. The co-benefits are measured through constant in situ monitoring and standardized benefit metrics. ","Fondo Accia³n is an Equal Opportunity Employer which aims to include community members in its work regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or other characteristics. They have provided in-depth training for their own staff as well as for local community members involved in project implementation. A key component of the benefit sharing distribution schemes currently being designed is to ensure that benefits (including employment opportunities) reach women and the most vulnerable and/or marginalized people in the community. The benefit distribution plans for this REDD+ project with indigenous communities is also rooted in locally created development plans, which were created with broad community participation following the internal rules of the Community Assemblies. Once the key activities for the benefit distribution plans are agreed upon, the next key step will be to determine who will be directly involved in its implementation. Additional procedures that guarantee equal opportunities for community members, including women and vulnerable and/or marginalized people, to fill all positions, including management positions, are now developed, and the protocols in the following links also describe the measures taken in order to ensure that the project proponent and all other entities involved in project design and implementation are not involved in harassment or discrimination, including discrimination based on gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or other habits.
During this monitoring period, there have been 438 women from the communities in the project who have participated in workshops designed to improve the development capacities of communities, including courses/workshops offered in: i) accounting, ii) financial analysis and evaluation of projects; iii) environmental and social project management; iv) marketing; v) administration and management; vi) leadership. In addition, 38 women have benefited from workshops and technical assistance in sustainable agriculture techniques.","Perceived Social Harm: Communities from the project area identified as a potential risk the possibility that the income generated by the project's facilitated economic alternatives would not be sufficient to cover the opportunity cost of a cessation of logging. This applies to families whose primary source of annual income was derived from timber, to those that use timber as a source of emergency income, and to a large number of stakeholders in the timber supply chain. Several mitigation measures were proposed. First, the use of wood for sustenance (e.g. construction, cooking) and cultural traditions would not be limited. Second, and representing the primary mitigation measure for this risk, a central focus of the project would be on developing long-term sustainable livelihood alternatives for participating communities. Tangible progress has been made in the facilitation of economic alternatives, including extensive hands-on training in sustainable cultivation techniques for cacao, aa§aa­, and plantain; initial agro-ecological research studies on chontaduro production; baseline analyses of artisanal fishing practices and piangua supply chain and sustainable harvest parameters; and infrastructure establishment and capacity building for ecotourism management with community organization Ecomanglar.",,,,,,

5. Project Certifiers: Verra, Verified Carbon Standards is the project certifying body.  ","The FNL Project is developed in a private property, the Fazenda ( Farm �) Nascente do Luar that correspond to Project Zone. At the Starting Date (20-04-2015) the farm was composed by areas already reforested with Eucalyptus spp. and by areas characterized by degraded grassland (because of the extensive and traditional cattle breeding) and the main activities developed in the farm were as below:
â–ª Cattle breeding for meet production (in degraded grassland).
â–ª Timber production from Eucalyptus plantations (also these areas before the planting were degraded).

The areas that corresponded to degraded pasture have become part of Project Area with the beginning of the Project and have been planted with Eucalyptus species too.
In the Project Area (and commonly in all other farms of the region) such grasslands have been historically subject to burns that took place with the objective to reduce tree covers, expand grasslands and stimulate the regrowth of tender and nutritious sprouts during the dry season when pasture becomes fibrous in order to develop extensive cattle ranching activities.

The property also conserve remnants of savannah forests and natural areas (Legal Reserve, minimum 20% of the land) but these latter were severely damaged due to the fire practice and the grazing of the animals. Irrational and  extractive � cattle farming, which had been practiced for decades before the start of the Project, led to a progressive impoverishment of the soil and to extensive erosion formation, which, together with significant environmental damage, gradually and inexorably compromised even productivity rates and economic returns deriving from livestock farming activities.

The Afforestation Project developed in the FNL Project relates to a total area of 342 ha.
This area correspond to the Project Area and is divided in 21 planted parcels of different extensions. All the parcels was planted in 2015, from April to December.

However the project has identified all the potential risk and a risk mitigation mechanism is in place ensuring long term viability of the project:

1. Fire Risk
2. Pest Infestation
3. Other natural risk  ",30,30,"The Project was planned with the aim of recovering degraded soil of the farm through the
planting of Eucalyptus trees characterized by rapid growth and high CO2 absorption
potential. Therefore the primary purpose of the Project is the highest CO2 absorption during
the lifetime of the Project.
To achieve this goal, during the 30 years of the Project no cutting of the plants will be carried
out.
The project has ruled out all the possibilities of physical reversal. ",The monitoring plan for the carbon credits inventory is provided in detail within the PDD document Section 5.0,"Risk of reversal is mitigated by having storing mechanism in place to avert any such situation. Since fire hazard could be most detrimental to sequestration efforts, a strong fore protection practice is implemented 
From the beginning of the planting the fire risk control was carefully taken into consideration. Indeed all the planted areas have been subdivided into smaller parcels, of various dimensions, with each one separated by anti-fire corridors of between 10 and 20 meters in width.
Risk of fires is practically non-existent during the raining season because of the high level of humidity present in both the soil and vegetation which of course prevent risks of development of any fire. During the dry season the fire risk goes up, but this is reduced by a specific management plan for fires. This plan respects the following control measures:

Identification of critical sectors: among these we need to single out the streets with the highest flow of vehicles, walkways, workers homes, areas on the borders with rural habitation, where there is a risk of intentional or accidental fires, possibly even set of by an unextinguished cigarette butt.
Other important critical points could be electric cables capable of causing fires simply by a short circuit Break or by simply falling on the ground.

â–ª Development of firewall barriers: all the critical sectors are regularly ploughed (Photo 49) in order to remove the dry grass carpet which is highly inflammable, so as to eliminate all possibilities
of fire risk.
â–ª Training the operating staff in preventive measures and how to act quickly when fires occur: every year all the workers are obliged to attend an anti-fire course, divided in 2 both prevention and control. Each member of staff receives a professional certificate at the end of the course.
â–ª Provide the right elements such as water tanks, hoses, extinguishers, blankets, etc: All this equipment are always accessible and ready for use in case of any emergency, both during the winter months (dry season) and in the summer months (rainy season).
The practice of starting fires was used regularly in the baseline scenario, in order to burn the dead and fibrous grass during the dry season so as to stimulate the growth of green shoots which are very appreciated by cows.
This illegal agricultural practice was not executed under any measure or control. As of result of this practice fire often occurred in the Legal Reserve areas, destroying all the vegetation and forcing the
fauna to flee. This increased the degradation of the soil as it lost minerals and porosity.

achieve the following sustainable development priorities:
The projects works on following UN SDGs

01 No poverty: prior to the Project, community workers were working with livestock, where
the wages are among the lowest. Thanks to the Carbon Project, it was possible to increase
the salary level to allow workers also an economic gratification, with consequent benefits to
their families.

03 Good health and well-being: life in continuous contact with an Eucalyptus forest has
important physical and psychological benefits: the nature, breathing good air is called forest
bathing (a practice that is offered and sold by operators precisely because of the benefits that
produces). Eating food that is self-produced from the land in the Project Zone is also a benefit
that has an impact on a healthy quality of life

04 Quality education: to develop the Carbon Project specific technical skills are needed
which are transferred from the Forest Manager to the workers. A multitude of hours of training
courses have been provided (both internally and with external trainers) that have generated
certificates and training is ongoing.

08 Decent work and economic growth: as mentioned in SDGs 1 there has been a
significant improvement in the quality of life of these workers and has touched key aspects of a person's life: type of work, financial stability, clean and healthy environment, training and
career opportunities. The Project Proponent will also make his managerial skills and
experience available to all workers that would like to learn specific subjects, starting
management and basic economics courses in order to transfer several skills.

13 Climate action: the Project addresses the problem of CO2 increase in a very concrete
and effective way having a positive impact on the micro climate of the region: in fact it
contributes to less water evaporation, less soil reflectivity, and a reduction in temperatures.
This could, if thought on a large scale, also have significant effects on the climate of the
region.

15 life on land: the Project gave a positive impact on the soil; before the starting of the
Project the land was characterized by erosions and degraded pasture. Before the plantation
erosions have been recovered, contour lines have been made on all the parcels, to reduce
the speed of rainwater on the ground and to increase ground water retention. After the
planting the soil improves the characteristics: macro and micro minerals improved due
mainly by fertilization. Also organic matter improved and this increasing is permitted during
the growth of the trees that cyclically change/lose branches and leaves that fallows on the
ground and remains in situ. This wood litter, with natural decomposition, integrates with the
soil in the form of organic matter. The Eucalyptus also produces lower soil susceptibility to
erosion: in fact, roots contribute to the stability of the soil, the Eucalyptus leaf foliage slows
down the impact of rain on the soil and the plant material accumulated on the soil slows
down the water descend during the rains on the most sloping soils. The arboreal coverage
also increases soil moisture, mainly outside the rainy season. As for biodiversity in the
specific case of the FNL Project different species of birds (including hawks, woodpeckers,
snakes-hunter birds and various species of passerines) mammals (including Anteaters,
Tapirs, Deer, Foxes, Wild Boars and numerous species of rodents), reptiles and amphibians
can be frequently found in the Project Zone. This is mainly due to the fact that the planted
forest areas are interspersed with Legal Reserve areas (which must account for at least
20% of the Fazenda land according to brazilian legislation) and grazing areas that normally
are home to an extremely varied fauna. This type of mosaic-shaped crop and environmental
diversification fully respects and can even enhance the biodiversity of the region, despite
the presence of a monoculture such as the Eucalyptus plantation. In the Fazenda Nascente
do Luar it is not uncommon to sight species of big predators typical of Cerrado region, as
the Puma (Puma concolor), the Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and the Manned Wolf
(Chrysocyon brachyurus). This species nowadays are considered threatened in many
countries of Latin America but are present in the Project Zone.
","Apart from environmental benefits project supports following co-benefits:

Social Benefits: Project activities have stimulated an increase in the local workforce employed in the Project Zone: when the unique activity of the Fazenda was the cattle breading only 5 workers were employed in the Fazenda (they were responsible for raising 1,500 to 2,000 beef cattle). Now because of the Eucalyptus plantations more than 30 workers are employed. It has also allowed the specialization and qualification of this workforce and thanks to this has produced a wage increase of these workers, with consequent benefits to their families","The project brings environmental justice to the local population:
With the project, soil productivity has been recovered and brought to maximum efficiency to combat climate change through the removal of CO2 and the restoration of biodiversity. The forest, in turn, has brought a positive impact on the micro-climate of the region: it contributes to a lower evaporation of water, lower reflectance of the soil and lower temperatures.
The key results on the environmental justice are as follows:
1. 342.7 ha of degraded land transformed into forest
2. 1,150 ha of restored and protected native forest
3. 428,375 trees planted in the Project Area
4. 25,090 tCO2e captured every year

- A high degree of certainty about both carbon captured and its safe long-term storage,
- Positive secondary social and environmental impacts, and
- A new use for degraded low rainfall farmland, adversely affected by climate change and where existing uses are increasingly unsustainable.

In principle our solution is very simple:
- Grow a multi-species selection of highly adapted, high biomass production Australian dryland, coppicing, woody plants on degraded, low rainfall, failing and previously cleared farmland,
- Periodically trim these plants of their above ground biomass (which will regrow rapidly given their coppicing characteristic), and
- Sequester this harvested biomass in safe long-term storage,by being buried and encapsulated in a subterranean burial chamber, engineered to close all pathways for biomass decomposition.

At present the EBS One project is a start-up. A CDR offtake agreement with Microsoft will allow us to raise funding for a comprehensive feasibility study necessary to secure project financing and equity investment for our first commercial CDR module. The lead times are short. If we can secure a CDR offtake agreement this calendar year, first-CDR is FY24 and commercial scale CDR reached by FY27.
 
Given the abundant supply of suitable land, our solution is highly scalable. We could be delivering over 150 million t CDR pa from Australian-based projects alone, by 2040. The global upper limit is well over 1 billion t CDR pa, dependent on land access and sovereign risk issues.
 
Our initial target area has no land access and sovereign risk issues, being freehold farmland in Western Australia. This land has been cleared for over 100 years. Our solution would essentially return the previously cleared woodland. Secure tenure is obtained by simply buying the land. If and when CDR is no longer required the land will be maintained as a native woodland, a fund having been set aside from CDR revenues for the perpetual management of this woodland and stored CO2.
 
An (EBS One and Microsoft) agreed proportion of profits earned from our first module will be re-invested in EBS One s CDR process and business performance improvement to minimize CDR costs without compromising regulatory, accreditation, environmental, customer and community obligations. We believe that a focus on cost reduction is not only good business but also that the delivery of affordable CDR, at scale, is critical to humanity s willingness and capacity to effectively address climate change.
","EBS One Governance Structure

EBS One is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) incorporated for the sole purpose of delivering on potential future CDR commitments to Microsoft. At present the company is managed and operated by Howard Carr and Simon Avenell. In the event that EBS One raises start-up funding and commences construction and operationalization of the first EBS CDR module, the company will be restructured to deliver fit for purpose best practice corporate governance. Significant offtake partners, start-up investors or debt funding providers will be invited to join the EBS One board of directors and to review and agree the company s charter, key committee compositions and codes of conduct and appoint external auditors, prior to the receipt of start-up funding.

Project Design and Implementation Roles and Responsibilities

The work to be undertaken in our bankable feasibility study exercise will allow us to start building our team of employees and external contractors. Specific roles and responsibilities will be detailed in this work. Note that the EBS leadership team has already identified a wide range of expertise to support project design and implementation including the following:
- Susan Hooper  “ Director, Chapter Zero

Management s Relevant Skills and Expertise

Within the pre-start up funding Feasibility Study, EBS One and consultants will complete, to the satisfaction of investors, a comprehensive Human Resources Plan including all management positions, the reporting and responsibility structure, and relevant measures of success. Once start up funding is agreed, EBS One will implement the plan and commence sourcing, interviewing and hiring key staff.

EBS One Pty Ltd key managers are:

CEO Howard Carr
COO Simon Avenell.

EBS One will be populated with professional managers and operators with the specific skills and relevant expertise required to contribute to the company s success. The company s CEO and COO will however remain ultimately responsible for the delivery of EBS One s carbon, environmental and social performance, particularly during start-up. 

EBS One s management capacity to deliver key outcomes is summarized below:

Carbon Benefits Delivery

- Howard grew up on, and worked for a number of grain production farms overseas and within the EBS target area. He has extensive experience in broadacre agricultural machine design, modification, maintenance and operation.
- He is experienced with hiring, management and supervision of broadacre grain production farm workers.
- He has extensive experience in earthmoving and drilling machinery operations and repairs including as a licensed machine operator (front end loader, bulldozer, excavator, and scraper). 
- Howard has experience in native tree propagation and worked in his family s commercial native tree nursery; propagating many of the high biomass production species identified by EBS.
- Howard  has extensive experience in the design management and execution of statistically valid sampling and assay programs and is an award winning GIS-based spatial analyst.
 - Simon has experience in the design and operation of compliance and reporting regimes.

Environmental Benefits Delivery

- Howard has been Exploration Manager and CEO of a number of ASX and TSX-listed mineral exploration companies, with environmentally-sensitive and award-winning, field programs in China, Australia, South Africa, Burkina Faso, Canada and Mexico. He has managed field teams of up to 40 local and expat workers and consultants, often in remote and environmentally sensitive locations. 
- He has an excellent record of culturally-diverse engagement with environment protection agencies, other government agencies, local stakeholders and workers. 
- Both Howard and Simon have scoped, reviewed, engaged and managed work programs with a wide range of technical and environmental experts and specialist consultants. 
- Simon has worked with all levels of government in Western Australia and has excellent working relationships with many key policy and environmental program players inside and outside government


Social Benefits Delivery

- At the WA Department of Agriculture Howard developed and operationalized the end point royalty plant intellectual property (IP) scheme. He developed and implemented an intensive, two-year stakeholder benefits education and buy-in campaign, and achieved >95% compliance. He continues to regularly connect with grain-grower / landowners of the EBS target area.
- He has community and stakeholder engagement success within the EBS target area including the development and operationalization of a phosphate mineral exploration programme on freehold farmland within the WA wheatbelt, requiring dozens of landowner access and ground disturbance permissions. He maintained continuous disclosures with, and achieved strong support from, landowners, local businesses and the local shire council.
- And Simon s exposure to government policy making gives him a good working knowledge of the critical issues in the EBS target area and the kinds of remedies that are both likely to be well received and effective.

Commercial Benefits Delivery

- Howard was investment manager of a successful biotech-focused venture capital fund located within a university  MWEP �. He designed, implemented, reviewed and managed a number of late-stage R&D to commercialization work programs. He continues to connect with biotech scientists. 
- He was senior resource analyst for Macquarie Bank; and continues to provide bespoke resource-sector investment analysis to private clients. He is experienced in the development and analysis of financial models and risk, and investor, shareholder and management engagement.
- He lead a number of successful public fund raisings, including authoring several short-form prospecti, for exploration companies. He has successfully lead companies of similar scale and technical risk, to EBS during start-up.
- Simon was a partner at PwC and a leader in regrowing PwC's consulting business in Australia from a team of less than 100 in 2009 to well over 1,500 staff when he left to focus on EBS in 2019. This included championing the diversification of the team and the introduction of values-based management. 
- While at PwC Simon also built excellent relationships within the Western Australian state government as leader of the firm's government business in the state.
- Simon also has extensive experience in business planning and performance optimization. Among other things at PwC he led the introduction of a mixed integer linear programming capability that allows for the comprehensive representation of all optimization decision-relevant information and options, integrated planning and the resolution of many of an organization's most demanding challenges. 
- Prior to joining PwC, Simon's first consulting experience was with a boutique strategy firm Mainsheet Corporate. At Mainsheet Simon was exposed to the challenges of a start up with a small but capable team. He took Mainsheet into new markets particularly and helped shape the business that was subsequently acquired by PwC.","EBS One is an, as yet, unfunded start-up enterprise. The founders have been exploring a range of change of land use solutions for the low rainfall, low productivity and profitability-challenged cropping areas of Western Australia over the last 10 years. The original concept that contributed to the development of  the EBS solution provided in this proposal, was to use high biomass production coppicing Australian woody plants grown in our target area for combustion-based electricity generation.  It transpired that the project s remote location and high capital expenditure and the local grid s configuration, ownership and access-restrictions made this a difficult investment proposition. However, the core concept  of using large tracts of low rainfall, low value, farmland for the production of large volumes of coppicing native biomass is technically, environmentally, economically and socially robust. In fact the use of this biomass in the EBS CDR solution is significantly more scalable than the electricity generation idea as geographic proximity to the local grid is not a constraining factor.

The novelty of our solution, the immaturity of the global CDR market and the underdeveloped state of venture capital in Australia have made it difficult for us to secure start-up investment. The Microsoft strategy to provide long term off-take agreements would make it possible for us to finance on reasonable terms the necessary feasibility studies to secure start-up and operational debt and equity funding.

We have recently incorporated two private companies under Australian company law, (i) Enhanced Biomass Sequestration Pty Ltd owned 100% by Howard Carr and Simon Avenell, and (ii) EBS One Pty Ltd, owned 100% by Enhanced Biomass Sequestration Pty Ltd. EBS One Pty Ltd is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) tasked with production, certification and delivery of CDR and carriage of our first CDR offtake agreement with our first offtake partner. Our vision is that in time, there will be many such SPVs with different equity arrangements and funding models to reflect future partner requirements. Enhanced Biomass Sequestration Pty Ltd will hold our EBS solution IP and will provide IP access and management services for the operations of EBS One Pty Ltd.

To date we have two main partners in this project. First, Puro.earth with whom we have completed a working, near-final carbon dioxide removal verification and calculation methodology. Puro is also playing a role in introducing the EBS solution to both potential investors and off-take customers. Second, EBS has agreed a memorandum of understanding with Maarli Service Pty Ltd, an Aboriginal owned civil contracting business based in our target area. (Maarli is the local Noongar language name for the black swan endemic to this region.) Beyond contracting, we are also exploring the potential for local aboriginal people to take a controlling equity stake in future EBS projects under the Australian Government s Indigenous business investment program. This program supports the creation of sustainable ventures that provide meaningful opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to accumulate wealth, develop their capacity to participate in Australia s economy, create jobs, increase training and skills development and supply goods and services.

If we can secure a CDR offtake agreement this calendar year, first-CDR is FY24 and commercial scale CDR reached by FY27. Given the abundant supply of suitable land, our solution is highly scalable. By 2040 we could be delivering over 150 million t CDR pa from Australian-based projects alone. The global upper limit is well over 1 billion t CDR pa, dependent on land access and sovereign risk issues. Our strategy is to focus first on off-take agreement projects in Australia which is a well regulated jurisdiction, with clearly defined and secure land tenure, reliable contract law and low sovereign risk. In this initial phase we will concentrate on process and business optimization delivering performance improvement and the development of robust business and operational processes that mitigate CDR risks and minimize costs per metric tonne of verified CDR, while efficiently and comprehensively meeting all of our regulatory, accreditation and community obligations. We will expand  only once we have built a sufficiently strong financial, corporate and business basis to operate effectively in spot and other carbon trading markets, possess the expertise and partnerships necessary to successfully deliver CDR in relatively complex jurisdictions, and we can license our IP and provide know how and support without necessarily having an equity stake in every CDR delivery SPV.",8/30/2023,Southern Cross,Western Australia,Australia,0,0,Yes,0,0,34000,0,139000,0,357000,0,498000,0,525000,0,536000,0,559000,0,513000,0,498000,0,475000,0,459000,0,456000,0,98.7,100,N/A,Yes,Other (please specify),Puro.earth CO2 Removal Standard,N/A,,,Yes,,"1. Biomass yield (biomass production per unit area) is a critical CDR and commercial performance risk for the EBS solution. However, our biomass yield projections are based on robust and very extensive biomass trial data reported in the scientific literature over several decades. (See attached file: Overview Project Design Document). Also note that in the generation of our biomass yield projections trial yield data is discounted and the positive yield impacts of a range of commercial plantation management practices are discounted or not included. And further, given the importance of biomass yield it will be a key focus of our ongoing process and business performance improvement program.

2. Related to the above, planting and plantation establishment is a CDR and commercial risk largely due to the scale of the operation and the limited planting window in our target area. We understand the challenge, have completed planning and logistics analyses, and developed new technology and processes to mitigate this risk, including the development of a supplementary watering program to support plant survival and growth over the first two summers after planting. Also note that while our target species have been primarily planted in trial and commercial plantations as seedlings, direct seeding solutions are emerging as a logistics-simplifying and time and cost-effective solution for the establishment of large scale native species plantations. EBS is actively exploring direct seeding options, including discussions with local university researchers and field practitioners. 

3. While CO2 storage reversals are an obvious and potentially important CDR and commercial risk, we are very confident that this risk is both well understood and appropriately mitigated and managed, as described elsewhere in this submission.",1000,1000,"We have indicated a durability term of 1,000 years which we believe is conservative given the optimal preservation conditions in our purpose-built subterranean storage sites and the evidence of long duration preservation in similar conditions (note that in situ coal s durability is greater than 290 million years). In addition, we can continuously monitor and regularly test the condition of the stored biomass, and readily take corrective action as required. Very long term funding for monitoring and management of stored biomass will be provided from an estate future fund (EFF) created from a small allocation from the monies received for  every CORC sold.
 
Root biomass is projected to account for around 15% of EBS total CDR and roots of the targeted species remain alive and viable for coppicing, for multiples of the EBS project life of 25 years. In the long term if  EBS solution CDR is no longer required we will mandate (via the charter of the EFF) that our retired plantations are rewilded delivering a further round of CDR albeit with the carbon stored in the living biomass of a perpetual woodland.  The carbon so stored in perpetuity would be at least the equivalent of the root credits issued. In a situation where this is not the case (i.e. where the EBS solution operates for more than 100 years on a single site) the EFF will be able to fund additional below ground sequestration to make up the difference.  
The scientific literature on the carbon balance of wood and wood products in existing landfills points to a very high proportion of CO2 being retained indefinitely, while suitable conditions are maintained. The critical biomass attributes and storage conditions which minimise biomass decomposition are well known, and commercialisation and optimisation studies continue. We have designed a biomass production, processing and burial system that specifically minimises biomass decomposition to maximise biomass-captured CO2 sequestration. We contend that our biomass-burial sequestration design and operational protocols will deliver more robust biomass-preservation conditions than a waste disposal landfill, because of the inclusion of the following features:
- The selection of burial sites with high clay content soil and near surface hypersaline groundwater
- A deep and narrow pit design to limit pit surface area
- The particular robusticity of utilised biomass including large piece sizes, high cellulose and high crystalline cellulose, tannins and chlorophyll content
- The formal compaction of biomass and enveloping high clay content layers in pit and the formal compaction of a covering high clay content soil sarcophagus at least 4.5 m thick
- Inundation of in-pit biomass with hypersaline groundwater
- Continuous and ongoing monitoring especially of the in-site temperature of the buried biomass as an early warning of exothermic decomposition reactions
- Active management and correction of flaws in the maintenance of the anoxic environment.
 
We have also made allowance for what we believe is a reasonable amount of biomass decomposition and physical reversal.  A buffer account of 1.5% of total CO2 stored is used as a starting point in our carbon accounting. This figure is the mid-point of the range (0 to 3%) quoted by Micales & Skog (1997) in a paper overviewing the carbon balance of existing municipal landfills which have received wood, and wood products with the primary purpose of disposing of waste, rather than sequestering biomass-based CO2. Other landfill carbon balance papers by Zeng (2008) and Ximenes et al (2017) quote different CO2 leakage figures, however all researchers in this area stress that accurate, universally applicable CO2 leakage figures from existing landfills are not possible in light of the variations in the physical, chemical and structural architecture of the buried biomass as well as the physico-chemical conditions of the landfill site itself. In our case it is likely that the buffer account will  be adjusted over time as buried biomass inert carbon data is accumulated from our ongoing testing and monitoring programs. 

On the other risks of physical reversals from fire, disease, pests or drought: only living root biomass and above ground biomass that has been successfully harvested, processed into chunks, measured, sampled, and transported to, and sequestered in, our purpose-built subterranean storage sites as described above, will be eligible for CORC generation and certification. Thus these biomass production risks are not reversal risks, but are commercial risks. 

The mixed set of selected native species are highly adapted to the environmental and climatic conditions of the EBS target area. They are fire tolerant and pest, disease and drought resistant. Our multi-species, symbiotic, ecosystem will in itself provide natural protection against pests and disease. Diseases and pests can be controlled by the use of readily available, cost-effective chemical treatments, if required.

Note also that our plantation layout includes 9m wide access and haulage corridors that offer excellent fire control and firefighting benefits. Fire risk is also significantly reduced by the core EBS activity of regularly removing the above ground biomass, and thus eliminating fuel load for potential combustion. Our plantation management regime includes continuous monitoring, weed control, and the ability to both quickly identify and respond to issues like fire, disease and pests.

Finally, note that we have been conservative in our modelling of our above ground biomass production. We have made a 20% discount on the research trial biomass production results for our selected species, only allowed for 50% of the observed Australian native hardwood plantation industry biomass production increase from fertilizer use, and made no allowance for the impacts of our supplementary watering program or the impact of coppicing in producing faster regrowth in successive harvest cycles.","Reversals monitoring has two components in the EBS solution: first an early warning system in the form of a set of networked temperature probes buried within the stored biomass, and second a regular program of direct sampling of the stored biomass to test contained carbon over time against carbon deposited in the burial chamber. The installed temperature probes work as an early warning system because all biomass decomposition pathways begin with the exothermic reaction  hydrolysis �. The stored biomass sampling program will be conducted via sealed drill holes through the compacted clay burial chamber cover into the buried biomass pile. A statistically valid set of samples of the buried biomass will be retrieved on a regular basis (and as otherwise required) and analyzed for total carbon content. Reversals will be revealed as the difference between the measured contained carbon at deposition and the measured contained carbon in the sequestered biomass.

As part of our commitment to working with all our customers in an open and transparent fashion our monitoring and audit data will be shared in full and live as possible such as in the case of the EBS early warning system. Summary reporting will be provided in a format and at a frequency to be agreed with each customer.","Biomass decomposition is the only potential source of physical reversals in the EBS solution. The risk, initiation, and rate of biomass decomposition generally increases:
- The lower the cellulose, tannin and chlorophyll content of buried biomass
- The smaller the piece size of the buried biomass
- The greater the mixing of the buried biomass internally, and with enveloping soils, and
- The greater the access to oxygen, light, and freshwater. 

EBS has designed a biomass selection, production, preparation, burial and containment system with multiple, concurrent, modes of actions to inhibit biomass decomposition. 

1. Biomass cellulose content

Impact:  Cellulose and crystalline cellulose in particular, are the most inert components of biomass (Kirk, T.K. & Cowling, E.B., 1984). The higher the proportion of these materials, the lower the decomposition risk. 

Action: The species selected for the EBS solution are all hardwoods characterised by relatively high cellulose and crystalline cellulose contents and are therefore inherently resistant to decomposition.

2. Biomass tannin content

Impact: Tannins are well known for preserving organic matter (e.g., leather). Tannins inhibit biomass decomposition (Da Silveiraet, al 2017). The higher the tannin content, the lower the decomposition risk..

Action: Many of the selected species are characterized by very high tannin contents and as such are inherently resistant to decomposition. 

3. Biomass piece size

Impact:  Large biomass pieces have low surface area to volume ratios, thus low surface exposure to decomposition organisms and thus lower decomposition risk. 
 
Action: In the EBS solution, harvested biomass pieces are kept as large as practically possible, to minimize decomposition risk. (Also note, the larger the piece size, the less energy is required and thus fewer emissions.)

4. Biomass chlorophyll content

Impact: Where conditions are suitable for biomass methanogenesis (methane generation via biomass decomposition) high chlorophyll levels have been shown to significantly slow the process (Chidthaisong A. & Conrad R., 2000). Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, and EBS aims to eliminate the risk of its generation. The higher the chlorophyll content of the buried biomass the lower its methane generation decomposition risk.

Action: EBS harvests and buries of all of the tree s above ground biomass including  the chlorophyll-rich leaves. The methane generation potential of the buried biomass is thus reduced with the high chlorophyll content. 

5. Burial chamber atmospheric exposure

Impact: Lower atmosphere exposure limits potential oxygen exchange and thus lowers biomass decomposition and reversals risk.

Action: The Biomass burial chamber trench will be a single cut of the scraper wide (<3m) and as deep as is safely and practically possible. The selected high clay content soil has inherently high soil rheology (strength) allowing for steep chamber walls and increased trench depth. Chamber target trench depth is 6m.

6. Burial chamber anoxic conditions

Impact: Lower burial chamber oxygen has two impact pathways to lower the risk of reversals; first, lowering biomass oxidation and directly limiting CO2 generation, and second lowering the risk of hydrolysis which limits sugar and organic acid formation, which in turn limits the diversity of viable microorganism species (to halophiles and methanogens only) and minimizes total microorganism counts; both of which reduce the risk of decomposition and reversals.

Actions: Burial chambers will be constructed and maintained for anoxic conditions.

7. Burial chamber soil hydraulic and gas conductivity

Impact: Low soil porosity has two pathways to reduce the risk of reversals; first it lowers atmospheric oxygen exchange which inhibits biomass decomposition, and second it inhibits the escape of any organic gases from within the biomass, increasing the partial pressure of these gases and shifting the  decomposition reaction equilibrium to lower levels of completeness. 

Action: Burial chambers will be covered with about 4.5 m of optimally compacted soil topped with a crushed rock hard facing, providing a robust seal of the burial chamber. The selected soils have been subject to definitive soil sampling and compaction testing and display hydraulic conductivities of around 10-10m/s (broadly equivalent to hot mix asphalt). Further, biomass will be deposited in multiple layers each separated by a layer of optimally compacted soils providing multiple barriers to atmospheric gas exchange. 

8. Undisturbed biomass

Impact: A stagnant biomass burial system will minimize nutrient (re)cycling and lower microorganism counts, thus reducing biomass decomposition potential and reversals risk.

Action: Buried biomass will remain undisturbed.

9. No light reaching buried biomass

Impact: No light falling on buried biomass limits the diversity of viable microorganism species (in particular halophiles) thereby reducing biomass decomposition potential and reversals risk.

Action: Buried biomass will be entirely removed from any source of light.

10. Hypersaline brine

Impact: The presence of hypersaline brines limits the diversity of viable biomass decomposition microorganism species (to halophiles and methanogens only) thereby reducing decomposition potential and reversals risk. Further note that halophiles and methanogens cannot survive in freshwater.

Action: Buried biomass chambers will be flooded with naturally occurring hypersaline groundwater. If halophile or methanogen micro-organisms become active, the affected part of a burial chamber can be readily flooded with freshwater, to kill the population.","EBS One will maintain a buffer account of 1.5% of all verified CDR and only charge Microsoft for verified CDR net of this quantity. EBS One will compensate Microsoft at the same price paid to EBS One, for any independently verified reversals that exceed the buffered quantity.
Puro.earth advises to maintain a buffer between offered quantities and the projected total annual CORC supply per supplier. This approach has not been reflected fully in the ""Volume by Period"" section and can be negotiated in the next steps with Microsoft.","The EBS One buffer account will include verified CDR from this project only. The EBS One project only recognizes removal tonnes.
",For the moment the buffer pool percentage is set at 1.5% of CO2 contained within the buried biomass. This is in line with estimates from the scientific literature as discussed in connection with durability above.  The buffer pool percentage may be adjusted to reflect the results of the EBS biomass burial trial to be completed prior to EBS start-up. The buffer pool percentage is also likely to be refined and adjusted overtime as EBS builds a multi-dimensional harvested and buried biomass compositional database.,Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"EBS is seeking to enter into a 25 year CDR offtake agreement with Microsoft. Ideally Microsoft will take all of EBS CDR production from its first module, with a projected 25 year life span and average annual CDR production of around 400,000 tpa for a 25 year total of around 10,000,000 t. Given the scalability of the EBS solution the provision of even more CDR would be possible and is of interest to us.

In the first instance we see three broad options for our partnership with Microsoft. Note each option allows for a range in duration from 10 to 25 years. Clearly shorter contract periods might reduce the benefit of locking in prices now (allowing for input cost indexation) global CDR prices rise over time as demand increases.

Ecosystem protection: Replacing exotic crops and grasses with native Australian woody plants, expansion of native flora and fauna species habitats, conservation and management of remnant woodlands, wild-fire management, and limiting desertification risks.

Social equity and justice: Replacing the existing climate-change-exposed cropping land use and economy with the EBS solution and economics allows for: Economic empowerment of local Aboriginal people, active inclusion of under represented groups, additional economic opportunity for the entire local community suffering from long-term economic decline.

Climate resilience: EBS land use adapted to deal with local climate change trends.",A very strong set of social and environmental co-benefits as would be expected from introducing a new land use that involves (1) restoring native woodland cover removed over a century ago to pursue marginally viable cereal cropping and (2) a net increase in employment and other economic opportunities in financially stressed and declining communities. All trends and the impacts from the changed land use can be tracked in detail using commercially available geospatial economic modelling platforms. These systems integrate publicly available and other proprietary datasets including self generated data. (See for example PwC s GEM platform https://www.pwc.com.au/analytics/gem.html).,"The entire community in our initial target area is dependent directly or indirectly on the success of local farming, dominantly cereal cropping. And this is already suffering the adverse effects of climate change. The trend is to lower rainfall in the winter exotic crop (primarily wheat) growing season with increasing rainfall in the summer which is of no benefit to the dominant existing land use pattern. (Total average annual rainfall is rising slightly or stable which is ideal for the mixed native species plantations we have in view.) This means that exotic crop production is progressively becoming more and more marginal and less sustainable. With resultant problems of falling incomes, employment decline, financial and community stress, long term population decline, and poor health and educational outcomes.

The EBS solution offers a sustainable  new economy  land use that can underpin the revitalization of these hard-pressed communities. At base this follows from the fact that the EBS solution is a higher value land use, with revenues about double those of current land uses per unit area. And further, with grain production and exports rising in the Black Sea zone, prices for the traditional products of our initial target area are likely to be stable at best, while the prospect is for the price to rise for verified CDR. Without a solution like EBS the outlook for our initial target area is dire indeed.

And as bad as the prospects are for the community in general in our initial target area, the prospects are even worse for the Aboriginal people within this community. Our approach is to not rely on trickle down benefits to improve the lot of this group that has been systematically marginalised (and worse) since European settlement. Our strategy is one of economic inclusion and empowerment. Beyond a program to actively recruit and retain Aboriginal employees and preference Aboriginal businesses in procurement, we are also exploring the potential for local Aboriginal businesses to take controlling equity stakes in future EBS projects under the Australian Government s Indigenous Investment program. The object here is to provide business investment, leadership and career opportunities that have not typically been open to Aboriginal people, and certainly not in our initial target area. It is important to note that  place  particularly matters for Aboriginal people who often speak of the land they belong to, not the land that belongs to them.","We foresee no negative environmental and social impacts from this project. In fact, there are significant environmental and social co-benefits from the EBS CDR solution as set out in our response to the two preceding questions. We foresee no local co-pollutants, no human population displacements or perverse incentives. Note also that biomass harvesting of the type envisaged is not  deforestation  as the trees coppice and regrow after harvest. The trees are alive and capturing atmospheric CO2 during the entire project life.

Electrical energy usage for this project is minimal, mostly for communications, measurement and monitoring systems, and on-site offices and team facilities. Solar PV and deep cycle battery powered systems will be deployed in all these cases.

EBS One will use diesel fuels to power its mobile equipment, while being alert to the potential to change to clean fuels in the future. Indeed, given that our CDR revenues will be net of the CDR used to offset our own emissions, we have a carbon price built into our diesel fuel costs and an increased incentive for switching to clean fuels as soon as feasible.

Diesel fuel combustion is our main direct source of operational CO2 emissions. Actual diesel fuel usage will be monitored, reported and independently audited during the course of the project. CDR credits will only be issued net of the quantity of the emissions associated with diesel fuel use. This process will be managed as part of our Puro.earth accredited carbon dioxide removal validation and calculation methodology. Note also that we will use nitrogenous fertilizer because of its strong positive net impact on biomass production, CDR and our project economics. As for diesel fuel, the emissions impacts of this fertilizer, in its production, transport to site and use, have been taken into account in the projections of the EBS One financial model (including  CO2 equivalent for N2O released). Again, as for diesel fuel, actual fertilizer usage will be monitored, reported and independently audited during the course of the project. CDR credits will only be issued net of the quantity of the emissions associated with fertilizer use. This process will be managed as part of our Puro.earth accredited carbon dioxide removal validation and calculation methodology.

While our solution should probably not be regarded as a forestry project, rather a shift from one agricultural cropping land use to another, it is worth noting that forestry and land clearing are robustly managed by governments in Western Australia and the other Australian jurisdictions, as well as being the subject of intense public scrutiny. The expansion of the agricultural region of Western Australia has been effectively banned for at least 40 years. All clearing of native vegetation is subject to a permitting process under the Environmental Protection Act (1986) administered by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation. This act applies even to remnant native vegetation on freehold farmland and it is a criminal offence to clear land without a permit. On this basis we are of the view that the change in land use we envisage under the EBS CDR solution will not influence other land use decisions taken by the Government of Western Australia.",,,,,,
RAINBOW BEE EATER PTY LTD,,AUSTRALIAN CARBON DRAWDOWN PROJECT PIPELINE>>100KT/Y CO2-e,Rainbow Bee Eater Pty Ltd,Other (specify),"PyCCS, Biomass conversion with pyrolysis to stabile storage in biochar",,,"OPPORTUNITY All over the world, every year, billions of tonnes of green wastes are burned or landfilled. This is mostly invisible to those of us who live in cities - which is most of us.   Many of these residues are economically accessible and can be converted into useful forms of bio-energy for heating, drying or electricity and biochar for long term environmental services including soil and water remediation and carbon sequestration using safe 21st century, circular economy, job rich carbon negative processes.   SOLUTION Rainbow Bee Eater (RBE) is a single purpose Australian owned company formed in 2009 to “Develop and supply modular biomass to energy and biochar systems with benchmark cost, environmental and social benefits’’ With our Australian partners, RBE developed the ECHO2 system which uses a process that mimics Mother Nature to safely convert green ‘wastes’ into affordable biochar and energy. RBE understands that ECHO2 environmental and financial performance is very attractive compared to other systems currently available globally – producing a high yield of stable, high carbon biochar and clean syngas.   The first commercial demonstration of ECHO2 was commissioned in 2019 and heats the Holla- Fresh herb growing glasshouse using recycled wood provided by large local organics recycler BioGro. BioGro add the biochar to their composted products that are used for horticulture and agriculture.   Current Holla-Fresh production forecasts and a recent Life Cycle Analysis (attached) indicate that this first project will be at least 3,000 tonnes CO2-e carbon negative in FY20/21. This includes the land fill emissions avoided by using this ‘waste’ wood and excludes the reduced emissions resulting from the benefits of biochar both in the composting process and in the soil.   RBE and Holla-Fresh have recently partnered with PURO because of their verifiable voluntary market CORC mechanism for carbon drawdown that is credible to international buyers and sellers. The CORC scope excludes both the avoided emissions from land fill and from the biochar in use. We expect to generate at least 1,000 CORCs in FY20/21 and are offering 500 CORCs for this first Microsoft CDR period.   RBE has identified a pipeline of over 50 commercial energy and biochar projects in Australia each of which has similar carbon drawdown potential. Three case studies are included in the Attachments.   The credible verification offered by PURO and the secure carbon drawdown revenue offered by Microsoft will result in faster deployment of these 50 projects.

For the same reason reversals are not expected in our project, because the verifier checks that the biochar is not shipped to combustive use. Generally accepted durations for biochar are 100-1000 years for biochar.  The durable storage of biochar and the carbon dioxide embodied in it can be estimated with the O:C ration received from the laboratory test. In general, a molar ratio of O:C lower than 0.2 appears to provide, at minimum, a 1000-year biochar half-life. There is a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010), which allows to calculate a duration over which 90% of carbon in the biochar remains.  Puro methodologies always contain a buffer that covers premature reversals of carbon removal.

Low cost high quality biochar to enable larger scale applications for horticulture, agriculture, asphalt, compost, water treatment etc.   RBE intent from 2007 was to develop a business system that enabled carbon drawdown via affordable high quality biochar, financed by the co-produced bio- energy, from underutilised biomass residues that are burned or land-filed today.   We identified in 2008 that success would enable net carbon drawdown that could be quickly taken to very large distributed scale with multiple financial, social and environmental benefits to regional communities.   RBE view then and now is that the current international cost of high quality biochar (circa USD1,000/tonne or more) is well above the short term commercial benefits sought by many horticulture, agriculture, asphalt, compost, water treatment operators.   RBE reviewed all available technologies and decided that none were capable of achieving our 2007 intent without ongoing government subsidies of some sort.   The key we believed was to achieve high yield of high carbon biochar and clean cool syngas in one automated continuous process step.   In 2014 after we had failed to identify and test any technology that achieved this, RBE decided to develop what became ECHO2.   Since 2017 we began to commercialise ECHO2. We signed with Holla-Fresh in 2018.   Multiple feasibility studies since then have confirmed our belief that the ECHO2 mass and energy balances enable good financial, social and environmental   outcomes including affordable biochar (circa USD200/tonne). We believe ECHO2 is unique in this regard,   Since 2007 RBE has played an increasingly active role in the emerging biochar markets and where possible co-operates with other industry players. We are active members of the International Biochar Initiative, Australian and New Zealand Biochar Industry Group and European Biochar Industry Consortium.   ","All of the 50 currently identified projects utilize local residues that would otherwise be landfilled or burned such as from plantation forestry, wood processing, woody weeds, construction, city green wastes and crop residues.   Each ECHO2 module uses ~20kW of electricity to turn drives and power control systems. At Holla-Fresh this is currently grid purchased electricity @ 0.44kg CO2-e per kWh.   The overall Holla-Fresh site usage is ~ 50kWe. RBE has installed an 80kWe gas engine powered generator to be fuelled by some of the ECHO2 syngas. This is expected to be commissioned later in 2020 and to reduce Holla-Fresh purchases from the grid by ~75%.   The recycled wood used by the ECHO2 module at Holla-Fresh is hand sorted construction and demolition wood that would otherwise be burned or landfilled. The biochar produced from the recycled wood at Holla-Fresh is suitable for use in very large scale applications that require lower cost biochar such as composting, asphalt and concrete. Because of the potential for contamination in the recycled wood, the biochar is not suitable for animal feed which requires higher cost low impurity biochar from fresh residues such as from crop and plantation forestry and timber and food processing.   Of the 50 future projects, the majority are projected to be based on fresh biomass residues. ",,,,,,,
rePLANET,Yes,Restoring mangroves in Honduras lost for fuel or shrimp ponds,"Restoration of mangroves removed for shrimp ponds and firewood in the Gulf of Fonseca, Honduras",Forestry (removal only),,,Reforestation,"In the Honduran section of the Gulf of Fonseca, most mangroves are located inside protected areas that are managed jointly by ICF (Honduran Forest Conservation department) and CODDEFFAGOLF, a Honduran NGO tasked with the on-the-ground management for ICF). However, despite the protected area status there are a number of communities living within the areas on a semi-legal basis. Whilst the entirety of the land belongs to the Honduran government these communities have been issued a usofructo status (i.e. they are allowed to inhabit it and make use of surrounding land to make a living). This indeterminate position between being a protected area and allowing for local community development has resulted in 52% of mangroves in the Gulf of Fonseca being lost between 1999 and 2015. The major drivers of this deforestation were the development of areas for shrimp ponds and collection of firewood for cooking and fuel. Many of these shrimp ponds though now lie abandoned because the crops have failed, and communities remain impoverished. Some of the communities are holding out for commercial shrimp farms to buy up their abandoned fishponds, but there has been no progress at all on this front largely because the land is located inside protected areas and thus belongs to the Honduran government, which makes commercial exploitation by large scale businesses non-viable.

This project has been put together to address the problems faced by these communities. Approximately 1500ha of destroyed mangrove forest is being targeted for reforestation in communities where they have agreed to reforestation programmes in exchange for the funding to develop small businesses including alternative fuel options. The carbon rights for this project have been granted to CODDEFFAGOLF, which have agreed to sell these to the project developer (rePLANET) in exchange for funding the reforestation and business development programmes in each community (this amounts to 60% of the income they will receive for the sale). The Project Idea Note has been submitted to Plan Vivo and the Project Development Document (PDD) is currently being completed (the PPD for the first 700ha to be submitted by November 2021 and a second PDD for an additional 700ha to be submitted by February 2022) and planting is due to start in February 2022. As each community is reforesting their own areas this planting stage should be completed within 3 months and so sites should be available for auditing and issuing of credits by June 2022.
","rePLANET is a UK based company (company number 13335875) and represents a joint venture between three organisations (Operation Wallacea, Hoffmann Family Foundation and the Global Footprint Network; see below) with complementary skills. The purpose of rePLANET is to fund the development of mangrove restoration around the world using private sector funding via the voluntary carbon markets. As such, rePLANET is the project initiator and provider of funding for the scheme either through impact investors and subsequent sale of carbon credits or through investment in the whole scheme by a corporate partner. The company has already invested in the development of PIN proposals in several countries including Indonesia, Honduras and Mexico.

Operation Wallacea (Opwall; http://opwall.com/) has been running biodiversity and climate research programmes for over 25 years in a series of remote areas in numerous (mainly tropical) countries. Their model involves funding more than 200 academics in clusters to complete research at selected sites over a two-month period from June to August each year. These highly intensive field research programmes are funded by tuition fees paid by more than 3000 students each year who then have the chance to work alongside international scientists, which so far have published nearly 600 papers in peer reviewed journals (https://www.opwall.com/research-library/). What Opwall brings to this joint venture, besides scientific expertise, are links to effectively run local NGO s or small businesses in the areas of the world where reforestation is needed. These organisations have been working with Opwall for up to 25 years and are able to provision and support large expeditions to remote areas. These are the same skills needed to understand local communities, how governments work in their areas and how to cost effectively deliver projects on the ground. 

The Hoffmann Family Foundation (https://www.hoffmanfamilyfoundation.co/) bring skills in management of large-scale companies and financial management as well as having been responsible for funding charities to develop small businesses and develop leadership skills in developing countries.

Global Footprint Network (https://www.footprintnetwork.org/) is an internationally recognised Natural Capital think tank with numerous international environmental awards. Since being founded in 2003, their National Footprint Accounts have been included in countless reports by organizations like the World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), UN Environment, and the European Environment Agency. They have engaged with more than 70 country governments on six continents and partnered with over 80 organizations. Over 15 national governments have applied the footprint metric to their own policy initiatives.

CODDEFFAGOLF (https://coddeffagolf.org/) are a Honduran NGO established in 1988 to manage protected areas in the Gulf of Fonseca for the Honduran government. As a result, CODDEFFAGOLF have long established working relationships both with the Honduran government and with local communities within the protected areas. CODDEFFAGOLF are responsible for ensuring the community developments agreed with each of the 20 communities involved in this programme are delivered in full and that both the planting and maintenance of mangroves over the 25-year period of this project is achieved.

Coastal & Marine Research (CMR) are a Honduran NGO that will be acting as rePLANET s eyes and ears on the ground to ensure the project and costs are regularly audited, and if any shortcomings are identified they can be rectified quickly. The founded of CMR, Juan Carlos Carrasco is a leading expert on mangrove ecosystems in Honduras and is a long-term partner of Opwall. 

The Wallacea Trust (https://wallaceatrust.org/) will also be completing quarterly reviews of the whole project and its implementation to provide an additional layer of inspection and certainty that the project is being delivered effectively. The Wallacea Trust is a UK registered charity that supports the development of business solutions to environmental challenges and has a strong group of Trustees drawn from academic, business and NGO backgrounds.

A last level of assurance is provided by the Oxford University Long-term Ecology Lab (https://oxlel.zoo.ox.ac.uk/) who will be developing an online platform that will contain recent photographs (within 6 months) and data (communities or families benefiting from the carbon credit funding, amount of carbon stored, etc ¦) on each of the hectares in the scheme and which can be publicly accessed by stakeholders and interested parties. This is to provide greater transparency of the project than can be achieved from 5-yearly certification body audits and means that any purchaser of credits can be identified as the owner on the relevant website page for each of their hectares and they can monitor progress for themselves.","The project was initiated after academic teams from Operation Wallacea had completed a review of how carbon was being accounted for in mangrove environments and realised that the quantity of carbon was being significantly underestimated. The sediment below mangroves can contain up to 800 tonnes of carbon per hectare. When mangroves are removed much of this carbon becomes oxidised as the tidal or riverine currents scour out the sediment. Planting mangroves and establishing their root systems locks in whatever carbon is remaining at the time of planting which can be measured by coring. However, it cannot be assumed that all the remaining carbon would have been lost, so areas of mangroves that were cleared more than 25 years ago need to have their remaining carbon measured and subtracted from the figures for the areas being planted to determine the net residual carbon. Calculating net residual carbon means that at the point of planting ex-post credits can be issued for the sediment carbon which would otherwise have been lost by chemical and physical processes. Please note that this is very different to avoided deforestation projects where the assumption is that in the absence of funding a particular area of forest will be lost. This relies on assumptions about human behaviour which are much more uncertain than the certainty of the physical and chemical processes involved in the loss of the remaining net residual carbon stocks in the sediment. It also means that accounting for this element of carbon storage allows the costs of reforestation credits to be brought down to a competitive level.

The Hoffmann family realised the potential to use voluntary carbon credits to be the main driver of mangrove reforestation and to restore all the mangrove lost the last few decades for just a fraction of the funding being directed at voluntary carbon credits. They funded the capital for rePLANET to be formed and asked Operation Wallacea to identify ten projects in different parts of the world that would each produce one million credits. To date seven such projects have been identified in Indonesia, Honduras and Mexico and other projects are in the project development stage. The first of these projects to receive letters from the government allowing the carbon credits to be issued to the rePLANET partner is in Honduras and consists of 2 x 700ha of the Gulf of Fonseca that should together produce 2 million credits. The PIN has submitted to Plan Vivo, the agreements are in position with the partners and with the carbon approval letter in position then there is nothing preventing this project from being implemented. The PDD which includes coring is being currently completed and the first 700ha PDD will be submitted by November 2021, which would allow two months for final approval from Plan Vivo before mangrove planting initiates in February 2022. The project is designed in a way that each community replants their own areas under supervision from CMR staff so the planting should be completed within a 3-month period so auditing can happen for the first 700ha in May 2022 and credits issued in June 2022. The second 700ha will be two months behind this schedule with credits issued in August 2022.",2/1/2022,"Alianza, Choluteca, Marcovia, Nacaome, Namasigue (*please see maps in attached PIN document)",Choluteca and Valle Departments,Honduras,500000,500000,Yes,500000,,,,,,,,194000,,,,,,,,,,142000,,,,,,,,99,50,"See project history section for description of net residual carbon in the sediment which is a form of avoided emission. However, unlike other forms of avoided emissions which require assumptions about human behaviour, the continuing loss of carbon from the sediment, unless the area is reforested, is an unstoppable chemical and physical process.

The accumulation of carbon from Above Ground Biomass (AGB), Below Ground Biomass (BGB) and new accumulation in the sediment is 250 tonnes per hectare from numerous published papers. The unknown element is the amount of carbon remaining in the areas to be reforested (net residual carbon) and this is being determined from coring both the areas to be reforested and control areas (areas cleared more than 25 years ago) during the PDD process. Conservatively it is estimated that this coring will show at least 250 tonnes (50%) of the total carbon from the project is from this source.",Yes,Other (please specify),PLAN VIVO (www.planvivo.org).

Highly unlikely since the Honduran government has resisted this pressure to date. Also, the implementation of this project on the ground will provide income to communities for protecting mangrove forests, which make this risk is even more unlikely;

2) The death of key people involved in the project over its 25 year duration derailing the scheme. However, the project has been designed at an organisational rather than individual level, so the inevitable loss over the 25 years of some key participants should not affect the progress of the project;

3) Natural disasters such as lightning strikes, tropical storms or tsunamis. On average there is a very low probability (see Durability and Risk of Physical Reversal section) this will happen to any specific area of mangrove over a 500 year period, which gives an even lower probability of this happening over the 25 year duration of this project. However, if it were to happen then the 20% of credits held back by Plan Vivo (see Reversal Compensation section) from all projects as an insurance against such losses would be used to replace any lost carbon.",1000,25,"The most likely threat affecting reforestation schemes is fire. However, fire is far less of a problem (excluding limited fire caused by direct lightning strikes) for mangroves with their high-water tables and daily basal inundation with seawater. The remaining risks have a much lower probability for any particular area of mangrove. It is difficult to get accurate data on the probability of tsunamis, lightning strikes or tropical storms completely destroying any particular area of mangrove. However, the annual rate of mangrove loss is around 1% per annum (i.e. 100 years for any particular area of mangrove). However over 95% of the annual losses are man-made which would imply a return rate of 2000 years.","Each village receiving business development payments under the project scheme will be contractually required to provide multiple photos of each hectare from agreed points every 6 months, which will be then uploaded to the project website (provided by Oxford University's Long-term Ecology Lab). In addition, the village will need to annually measure diameter at breast height (DBH) on a sub-sample of trees in each hectare so that carbon storage information can also be made available on the project website. Provision of these data will be linked to release of development funds for each community. The Honduran NGO Coastal & Marine Research (CMR) will be auditing these results and cross referencing a sample of the measurements. The independent Wallacea Trust will be monitoring these results and their independent reports will be available to the buyer which will alert them to any shortcomings within the project.","Contracts set in place with each community, that not only require them to ensure the reforested areas survive but also stop any other mangrove removal activities in exchange for funding business development and alternative fuel sources, will provide a financial incentive to continue protecting the mangroves.

The alternative is to use one of the impact funders who will be investing in order to sell the credits at substantially higher prices.

The accumulation rate over 25 years in five year blocks has been estimated from published papers from areas of mangroves that were previously clear felled and then replanted over different time periods. In practice though these figures have been pitched at a level that is likely to be an underestimate of the observed levels and the 5-yearly audits including coring and measurements of AGB will provide accurate data on the amount of credits available after the carbon has been sequestered.

The net residual carbon in the sediment at this stage has been estimated from peer reviewed papers for measured levels of remaining carbon in similar areas and time periods since mangroves were removed. However, during the PDD stage 2-metre cores are being taken from areas to be reforested and also from areas that were deforested more than 25 years ago (to use as control areas). So by the time planting starts the net residual carbon will have been measured rather than estimated.",1400,10 tonnes per hectare per year,Faster sequestration during the first 10 years after planting after which sediment sequestration rates decline. To offset this though the middle period of AGB sequestration is the fastest because of asymptotic curve growth rates.,"Ecosystem protection  “ one of the reasons for which communities are keen to see mangroves reforested, after having lost more than 50% of mangrove forest since 1999, is because of the protection they provide against tidal surges and also their importance as fish nurseries. Furthemore, there are biodiversity benefits from reforesting destroyed areas of mangroves.

Social equity and justice  “ 60% of the income from the CODDEFFAGOLF carbon credit sales is funding business development in the participating local communities, thus increasing expanding their sources of income stream.

Climate resilience  “ This project provides an example of how the causes of mangrove loss can be tackled and damaged areas reforested using carbon credits at a competitive price. The outcomes ofthis project also provide increased carbon storage, increased fish recruitment (due to more availabilty of fish nurseries) and also additional protection against tidal surges.
","The financial benefits to participating communities will be monitored and reported annually.

The biodiversity benefits will be monitored using the following metrics every 5 year period (eDNA sampling to determine total species richness of invertebrates and vertebrates; standardised fish trapping to determine site usage by juvenile fish; standardised point counts and visual encounter transect surveying to determine usage by birds and reptiles, respectively; Malaise traps to quantify the increase in arthropod biomass)","This project funds the development of businesses in the impoverished local communities using microfinance loans as one mechanism. In addition, income generating projects such as bee keeping for honey production, mud crab harvesting and ecotourism projects will be suggested to those communities interested in developing these income streams. Operating procedures for CODDEFFAGOLF require that 50% of the businesses supported are run by women.","The payment to communities, via agreed development projects to reforest damaged mangrove areas and then to maintain them, might create a perverse incentive. This wouldn t apply to communities already involved because the continuation of their investment would rely on them controlling any further clearances of mangroves by their community members. However, communities outside the scheme might see continued clearance of new areas of mangroves as a way of attracting funding to their communities. This could be prevented by making it clear that any communities clearing additional areas of mangrove from the date that the first planting starts would be excluded from any future reforestation project. There will be no human displacement in this project  “ rather the concept is to increase the income of those communities already living in the protected areas.",,,,,,

Often eclipsed by the better-known forests of the Amazon Basin, the Atlantic Forest is an equally important part of Brazil s natural heritage and the planet s biodiversity.  Sixty percent of Brazil s endangered species live in the Atlantic Forest. There are 24,000 species of plants, mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles, of which 9,500 species exist nowhere else on earth. There are countless more unknown to science What remains of the once-great forest is a patchwork of remnants that are the last refuge for some of the greatest wealth of biodiversity on the planet. Over time, wide-scale deforestation has whittled the Atlantic Forest to five per cent of its original size. Consequently, this tropical forest, its rich biodiversity, and its ecosystem services are among the most imperilled on the planet. 

Saving Nature is working with Reserva Ecola³gica De Guapiaa§u (REGUA) to connect strategic areas of remaining forests to regain some of what has been lost. In this now mixed landscape of farmland, fragmented forests, and new housing developments, the wildlife corridors we are creating are the only real hope for gene pools of stranded biodiversity to move around. 
 
To secure a foothold in connecting isolated forests, we are creating a corridor in the lowlands. Having acquired strategic parcels of land, restoration efforts are underway. Our goal is to reforest 512 hectares with over 852,000 native trees. Once reforested, these trees will sequester over 256,000 tons of carbon dioxide and will provide safe passage for animals to move through and beyond to a 100,000-hectare forest block.  

Concurrent with the restoration work, Saving Nature monitors results of reforestation with annual drone surveys and species corridor utilization and ongoing camera trap surveillance.","REGUA is a Brazilian-based conservation NGO committed to the protection of the last remnant areas of Atlantic Forest. REGUA was established as a private non-profit association in 2001 (CNPJ32-532.012/0001-53) with a mission to protect the forests of the Upper Guapiaa§u river basin. It owns and manages a 7,385-hectare protected nature reserve and works in partnership with local landowners to protect an additional 4,213 hectares. REGUA has experience with verified carbon sequestration projects, having gone through the validation process in 2015 for another area of their reserve. 

Saving Nature, Inc. is U.S. nonprofit corporation granted tax-exempt status with the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization committed to rescuing endangered species from extinction and communities from environmental destruction. We reforest vital connections between isolated forests to promote species dispersal, genetic diversity and population rebound. These forests sequester carbon and provide essential ecosystem services in an era of climate change.  The team at Saving Nature has exceptional business management and scientific depth.

","The Atlantic Forest of Brazil, once more than a million square kilometers of dense tropical forest stretching from southeastern Paraguay and northern Argentina along the Brazilian coast to just south of the equator, is barely recognizable today.

Two of the world s largest cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, sit on top of what was once the Atlantic Forest. They still depend on its scattered remains for clean drinking water.

Often eclipsed by the better-known forests of the Amazon Basin, the Atlantic Forest is an equally important part of Brazil s heritage, Rio s source of clean water, and the planet s biodiversity. Notably ranking among the world s great forests, the Atlantic Forest of Brazil harbors exceptional numbers of plant and animal species.

Sixty percent of Brazil s endangered species are found in the Atlantic Forest. In total, there are 24,000 species of plants, mammals, birds, and amphibians, and reptiles, of which 9,500 species exist nowhere else on earth. Importantly, there are also countless more unknown to science.

What remains of the once great Atlantic Forest of Brazil is a patchwork of remnants that are the last refuge for some of the greatest wealth of biodiversity on the planet.  As the forest continues to dwindle, the increasingly stranded species have been called  the living dead � by Brazilian conservationist Antonio Rossano Mendes Ponte.

Over time, this wide-scale deforestation, Brazil s Atlantic Forest has already lost a great deal. In fact, barely five percent of the original forest cover remains today.  Consequently, this tropical forest, its rich biodiversity, and its ecosystem services are among the most imperiled on the planet. 

For over a decade, the team at Saving Nature has worked to restore and protect biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.  To do so, we joined forces with two local NGOs, Associaa§ o Mico-Le o Dourado (AMLD) and Reserva Ecola³gica de Guapiaa§u (REGUA) to begin the work of restoration and protection. Together, we are piecing together a beachhead for biodiversity and a sustainable long-term future for a critical watershed, which serves 13 million people living in Rio de Janeiro.

Since our first project launched in 2007, we have successfully reconnected two isolated forest fragments across a road to create a continuous protected area for the golden lion tamarin. We are now working to create our second wildlife corridor, which integrates a protected reserve with the first forested highway bridge in Brazil to create an even more expansive area for tamarins and other species.

Building our success, we inaugurated our latest project in 2019, supporting our local partner REGUA in their efforts to restore the health and resiliency of an important watershed for Rio de Janeiro. This multi-year project has the potential to ensure a sustainable future for biodiversity, communities, and the planet.

REGUA owns all the land in the project area and is responsible for:  

-Forest Restoration  “ REGUA has planted over 650,000 native trees since 2001. 
-Land Purchase Negotiations and Transactions 
-Wildlife Protection  
-Reintroducing native species, including the first Lowland Tapir (Tapirus terrestris) born in the wild in 100 years 
-Scientific Research and Monitoring  
-Environmental Education for School Children 

Saving Nature has been working with REGUA since 2019 to reforest a wildlife corridor to create a vital connection between two tracts of forest. The Saving Nature team brings business management and scientific expertise to the project. Saving Nature provides scientific guidance and financial support and is responsible for:

Without the project intervention, the land, likely will be transformed by residential development, permanently altering the landscape and the local community. 

1. Escalating land pricing related to real estate speculation - as developers descend on the area, land prices are increasing.

2. Fund raising - Having the financial resources is critical. Donor support has been strong, but funding from Microsoft in the form of carbon offset credits would be a game changes for the project.

3. Timing - Verra Carbon Certification is a lengthy process. Although our project complies with the VCA methodology, we are not yet fully certified and could risk losing opportunities to buy land when it comes into the market. We are fortunate that several potential partners are open to working with us through the certification process.

",30,30,"The durability of the project is based on scientific data and approved models that quantify carbon sequestration over time. 

We do not anticipate any reversals related to the project, based on the low potential for fire in the area, the lack of historic burning of forests or illegal logging. Should there be an unanticipated reversal, we will work to minimize the impact with the appropriate remedial actions.","Saving Nature and REGUA monitor the project on an ongoing basis to assess progress.  In addition to ground-truthing, we conduct annual drone surveys to asses forest cover.

","The main risks to the project are political risks, based on Brazil s governance score (of between -2.5 and 2.5) calculated from the mean of Governance Scores across the six indicators of the World Bank Institute s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), averaged over the most recent five years of available data. This political risk is mitigated by the project being on private land with clear land tenure, and not subject to government shifts in environmental policy.

The other potential leakage risk is fire. Based on the Verra Non-Performance Risk Tool v4, the probability of occurrence is between 50 and 100 years, and the significance level, estimated at less than 5% loss of carbon stocks, is low, based on the following factors: The area has no history of management through controlled burning. The vegetation would only be susceptible to natural fires following a long drought, which occurs once every 50-100 years. 

1. The surrounding area has considerable forest cover, which would serve as natural firewall, minimizing any significant spread. 
2. REGUA  s proximity to the planting locations provides rapid response time. 
3. The loss of carbon stock would be transient, with complete recovery in 10 years after the event.","We propose setting aside a buffer pool of 10% of the available carbon sequestered by the project. This pool would include credits from the Brazil project.

It is important to note that we plan to continue to expand our project scope and scale using the project proceeds to acquire and reforest additional land. Therefore, in the event of a reversal, carbon offsets related to this additional land could be made available to Mars.
","The proposed buffer pool would include only credits from our Brazil project.

However, subject to Microsoft's approval, we can make available carbon offsets from our other forest restoration projects to compensate for any unanticipated reversals. 


We are also open to other arrangements that Microsoft would propose.",We propose setting aside a buffer pool of 10%.,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Ideally, we would like to establish a long-term partnership with Microsoft that goes beyond transactional and offers true biodiversity benefits in addition to carbon offsets. Our partnership could include employee engagement opportunities to raise awareness about the benefits of Microsoft's investment in reforestation to rescue endangered species. We are open to working with Microsoft to be a leader in using funding from carbon offsets to address multiple issues related to environmental destruction facing the planet and local communities.",We are open to offering favorable pricing for a multi-year agreement.,"

Saving Nature - Atlantic Forest of Brazil 

Monitoring Plan 

 

The Project Monitoring Plan follows the AR-AMS0007 methodology to provide the collection of all relevant data necessary for: 

A. The verification that the conditions of applicability listed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 

methodology on the types of land use were followed 

B. The verification of changes in carbon stocks in reservoirs selected 

C. Verification of project emissions and leakage 

Should Mars require independent third-party verification, we are open to working with an approved auditor. We propose following established protocols, so that there is a consistent methodology across projects. 

MONITORING CARBON BENEFITS 

As detailed in UNFCCC (2005), before carrying out tree planting, we survey the project area with remote sensing and field visits. Using Google Earth, drone surveys, photographs, and secondary data analysis, we delineate and characterize the baseline scenario.  

After tree-planting, we survey the plots at regular intervals to assess the recovery. Project monitoring also provides important reference data for subsequent projects. In conjunction with remote sensing images, recovery data can be correlated with vegetation indexes for predictive modelling. 

Frequency of Monitoring 

Sample plots will be surveyed every five years to verify biomass accumulation and carbon sequestration rates.  

Measurement Procedures 

Our proposed methodology is defined by the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (2013), with ecological and carbon inventory carried out in sample plots in varying numbers according to the project area, as shown in the table below. Data collected will include GPS location, date, time, tree species, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, and status (healthy, stressed, deceased).

A > 1 

5 + (1 per additional hectare) * 

* Limited to a maximum of 50 plots, regardless of the project area  

Plot Size and Orientation 

Each plot will have a fixed size of 100 mÂ² and may be rectangular or circular. Rectangular plots will have a length of 25 m and width of 4 m. Circular plots will have a diameter of 11.3 m. Each rectangular plot will have its length oriented to a standardized northward position and not in the direction of the planting or sowing line. 

Plot Location 

Sample plots will be located at varying distances from the project perimeter to ensure a representational distribution and avoid grouping. The distance between sample plots will be systematized according to the number of sample plots necessary for the project. Within these parameters, sample plot locations will be randomized to avoid sample bias. 

Each plot will have its location coordinates and the direction of its orientation documented with a GPS device, with the coordinates recorded in UTM format. The location of each sample plot will be fixed using permanent georeferenced landmarks at their vertices (or at the center of circles in the case of circular plots), consisting of, for example, pilings of treated eucalyptus, galvanized iron pipes or rigid PVC pipes (Â¾ � or 1 �). 

Data Storage 

As established by the AR-AMS0007 methodology, the data collected will be archived for a period of at least two years after the end of the last reporting period of the project activity.  

Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) Procedures 

Quality Control / Quality Assurance (QC / QA) procedures will be implemented to ensure that measurements and monitoring of project carbon removals are accurate, realistic, verifiable, and transparent.  

QA / QC for data entry and analysis: To minimize possible errors in the data entry process, data entries will be audited and compared with independent data. The technicians involved in measuring and analyzing data will report and resolve any apparent anomaly before analyzing monitoring data. 

QA / QC for data and storage maintenance: Secure storage and maintenance of project data is critical, particularly for long-term projects. Data will be archived both electronically and in printed form, with copies provided to all project participants. All electronic data and reports will be stored securely in the cloud with backup copies on hard drives stored in an agreed location. Files include: 

Copies of all data from field measurements and spreadsheets of the analysis 

Estimates of changes in carbon stock in all reservoirs and the spreadsheets corresponding to these calculations 

Copies of measurement and monitoring reports. 

The table below shows the activities and procedures of Quality Control (QC) for data and storage maintenance. 

QC Activities 

Procedures 

Check that the assumptions and criteria of selecting data from a particular activity, sequestration and emission factors, and other parameters are sourced and documented. 

Cross-check descriptions of data for a particular activity, emission factors, and other parameters with information about categories of sources and sinks. Ensure that these are registered and archived in a manner appropriate. 

Check for typing errors during data entry. 

Cross-check a sample of entry data for each category source (measurements or parameters used to do the calculations) to detect errors entering data. 

Check that carbon sequestration rates are calculated correctly. 

Reproduce a representative sampling of emissions and sequestration calculations. 

 

Selectively validate calculations to determine accuracy.

Confirm that the relationships between data are correctly represented in the database. 

 

Ensure that data fields are correctly marked and have the correct format. 

 

Ensure the database structure and models are documented and archived. 

Check data consistency across categories. 

Identify parameters (e.g., data from an activity and constants) are common for multiple categories of sources and sinks and confirm consistency in values used for these parameters in emissions calculations. 

Check that data transfer between processing steps is correct. 

Check that the emission and removal date are correctly aggregated at lower and higher reference levels when preparing models. 

 

Check that the emission data and removal are transcribed correctly between steps. 

Check that uncertainties about calculated or estimated emissions and removals are resolved. 

Check that there is adequate input on validating uncertainty estimates. 

 

Check that uncertainty estimates are calculated correctly. 

 

If necessary, duplicate the error calculations for a small sample of probability distributions used in the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Conduct a review of internal documentation. 

Check that there is internal documentation for any detailed information that supports the estimates and allows reproduction of the estimates of uncertainty of emissions removal. 

 

Check that the inventory data, the data that support estimates and inventory records are archived and stored for easy review. 

 

Check the integrity of data storage arrangements for project documentation. 

Check consistency of the data series. 

Check consistency across algorithms / methods used in calculations. 

Perform thorough check. 

Confirm that estimates are reported for all categories of sources and sinks and for all years. 

 

Check that known gaps in data, which may result in incomplete emissions estimates are documented and handled in a conservative manner. 

Compare estimates with previous estimates. 

For each category, compare estimates of the current inventory with the estimates made previously, if available. If there are changes in significant trends or deviations from trends expected, estimates should be again checked, and the differences explained. 

 

 

MONITORING BIODIVERISTY BENEFITS 

Saving Nature monitors all projects to verify results. To do so, we deploy camera traps throughout the project to monitor which species are using the restored habitats. We collect camera trap ¯data ¯regularly, without creating an undue burden on the local team, taking into consideration that certain camera traps are installed in remote locations and are difficult to access. ¯ For arboreal species, we conduct annual in-situ transect surveys of the restored forests and use our extensive natural history experience to identify species that have returned.  

Frequency ¯ 

Our goal is to have imagery and videos uploaded, identified, and analyzed on a quarterly basis. For camera traps that are readily accessible, camera data are collected monthly. This provides adequate time to sort and catalogue the files. As this process is quite time consuming, we prefer more frequent and fewer numbers of files to large sets of data over an extended period. ¯ 

For the more remote camera traps, we require that camera traps checked at least every 3 months. This schedule balances the frequency of collecting the data with difficulty in accessing the traps and is based on battery life and card storage space. Upon checking remote traps, teams swap out the SD card and replace the batteries.  

Key biodiversity indicators are the diversity and number of species utilizing the corridor annually, relative to the length of time since reforestation efforts began. 

Confidentiality ¯ 

Some of the footage must be kept confidential to protect the location of species threatened by poaching or other risks. To do so, we maintain a Quarantine folder for all photos and videos with clear instructions on how they can be used. For example: ¯ 

For scientific research only ” Video cannot be shared publicly 

Video can be shared publicly, but details as to location must be censored 

Video clear to share publicly with no restrictions 

Check before sharing 

File Naming and Organization 

Since we are collecting data from projects around the world, it is important to have a common naming convention for our traps. Photos and video files are organized into folders with key metadata include in the files names.  

Camera Trap Folders  ”There is one folder for each camera trap, designated by the assigned camera trap number. ¯ 

Within the folder, each file name includes the month, day, year, and 4-digit photo number identifying the camera trap. (mm, yy, 1111). 

Each video is also identified by suffix with the species name. 

For example. Camera Trap 1 / 08180012.monkey 

Transmitting Files ¯ 

All files are upload to a shared OneDrive folder. Since data storage space can be expensive for our local partners, Saving Nature transfers the files to our data warehouse and confirms when they can be deleted from the shared DropBox to keep it available for the next upload. ¯ 

Digital Archive ¯ ¯ 

Saving Nature maintains a centralized database of all camera traps assets collected from our project locations. These data are available to our partners and can be accessed as follows: ¯ ¯ ¯ 

Log-in Credentials 

Folder Structure (country, location, trap ID) 

Quarantined Files will be stored in a separate archive with unique log-in credentials 

We also maintain a relational database with file directory, meta-data, and species identification information for each photo and video.  

Data Analysis 

To analyze the camera data, we sponsor conservation courses at Duke University that train undergraduate and graduate students in conservation analytics. We also work with Duke ™s technology incubator to develop machine learning, artificial intelligence, and remote sensing technologies to automate monitoring efficiency, accuracy, and reach.  

Policy - Non-Exclusive Access ¯ 

Except for quarantined information, we consider the camera trap information to be a shared resource. As such, the camera trap videos, photos, and data collected as part of our monitoring efforts, will be shared openly for scientific research, educational, and marketing purposes. ¯ ¯

6. Livelihoods","By reforesting a critical watershed in one of the most biologically rich and imperiled forests in the world, the project offers a range of biodiversity, livelihood, community, and watershed integrity benefits.  

These benefits include protecting one of the world s 25 biodiversity hotspots to prevent extinctions and promote reintroduction of species lost in the region due to reforestation. The project also protects a vital watershed for Rio de Janeiro s 2.5 million residents on the east side of Guanabara Bay. In addition, the project creates livelihoods for the local community in seed collection, nursery operations, tree planting, reserve management, community outreach, education, and ecotourism.  

1. Biodiversity - The Atlantic Forest is one of the top five biodiversity hotspots on Earth. Bio-inventories at REGUA confirm it is an important area of the Atlantic Forest for biodiversity and an area of high conservation priority. Its expansive forest cover, from humid forest in the lowlands up to montane elfin forest at 2,000 metres above sea level, wetlands, rivers, grassland, and farmland, fosters a high diversity of species. 

2. Water Stewardship - The reserve is situated in important watershed for over 2.5 million people on the East side of Guanabara Bay. This watershed provides clean drinking water to communities living and working throughout the region. The forests here are vital to protecting the headwaters of this important source of fresh water. Without them, landslides, silting, and flooding threaten the health and safety of thousands of residents. 

3. Climate Resilience - Our approach is a simple, effective, and scalable solution. Restoring degraded land and reconnecting isolated forests absorbs atmospheric carbon emissions and helps species adapt to climate change by finding safe harbors. In addition, the corridors we create liberate species trapped and isolated in increasingly inhospitable habitats. Reconnecting forests create escape routes for species seeking higher ground in an era of climate change. 

4. Education - Most of the local community have not travelled and perceive that the world is covered in rainforest and habitat loss is acceptable in the name of progress. To provide context, understanding and appreciation for Brazil s unique natural heritage, REGUA s environmental educators have developed, organized, and manage a variety of education programs. The education programs provide an opportunity to influence future thinkers and enlist them the conservation in action. 

5. Livelihoods - The restoration program employs local community members in a continuous seed to tree process, in which the community benefits economically from conservation efforts. The project hires individuals from the local communities, creating direct financial benefits.","Deforestation disproportionately impacts the most impoverished communities, degrading basic ecosystem services. Connections between protecting biodiversity, particularly in the tropics, and human health are well established (e.g., Sustaining Life: How Human Health Depends on Biodiversity. Eric Chivian and Aaron Bernstein, editors. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Pimm wrote the book s first chapter.). These connections include  ecosystem services  such as pollination, and protection of water supply and quality. Trees absorb ground water, plant biomass reduces evaporation, and aquatic plants and animals filter and purify water.

The project aims to GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable development goals.  The project involves including 1 district and 7 counties with a total population of nearly 7,800,000. 16,339 villagers were hired by Guizhou Xinzhanxin to plant trees. All the barren lands for afforestation activities belong to the villagers and the village committees manage the lands on behalf of villagers, the planted trees also belong to the local village committees. The forest land involved in the project is categorized as ecological conservation forest which is strictly banned to be logged for any reasons according to China s Forestry Law. There was no natural renewal and reforestation before the project, and some sites were covered by sparse shrub. Therefore, the project does not include activities that convert native ecosystems to generate GHG credits, which means the eligibility criteria of VCS AFOLU projects are fulfilled.

Guizhou Xinzhanxin Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. has been fully authorized by all the village committees to act as the project proponent. They consolidate fragmented and small forest land into a sizeable forest project and implement project management and monitoring with the assistance from the local forestry bureaus. Guizhou Xinzhanxin will profit-share with the villagers from selling VCUs. On March 5TH 2015, Guizhou Xinzhanxin Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. signed the Consulting Agreement with Shanghai Libra Investment & Management Co., Ltd. On October 20TH  2020, Search Co2(Shanghai) Environmental Science & Technology Co. Ltd purchased the whole crediting period of this project and signed VERPA with Guizhou Xinzhanxin. 

The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 21,225,014 tCO2e over the next 29 years. So far, 837,748 tCO2e (vintage of 2016 to 2019) were already issued, the balance of GHG emissions in crediting period is 20,387,266 tCO2e, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 815,490 tCO2e for remaining years.

Guizhou Xinzhanxin Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. has been fully authorized by all the village committees to act as the project owner and proponent to implement project management and monitoring. Then Guizhou Xinzhanxin works with the local Forest Bureaus and Shanghai Libra Investment & Management Co., Ltd (as project developer) to work out a better implementation plan for the project. 

Guizhou Xinzhanxin s staffs formed the Working group; Shanghai Libra Investment & Management Co., Ltd set up a team together with relevant technical personnel from Local Forestry Bureau and act as the Expert group (Management team) who is in charge of guiding and coordinating the project's overall implementation and decision-making; The Working group and the Expert group jointly provided project guidance, training and various notifications to local villagers and committees in the project area

Capacity---
Guizhou Xinzhanxin has rich experience in planting and forest management in Guizhou Province, including artificial afforestation, forest protection and management, forest damage control and technical training. 

The local Forestry Bureau provide technical advice and training to technicians and project proponent s staff to measure and monitor actual greenhouse gas removals and leakages from proposed project activities. Forestry bureaus already set up an expert pool on the land, soil, vegetation, animals and other natural resources affected by forests. Besides, forestry bureaus fed massive data to the biodiversity report and the experts from that pool will provide assistance and share experience during the biodiversity monitoring.

Shanghai Libra Investment & Management Co., Ltd has rich experience in carbon measurement and monitoring. In the past, Shanghai Libra has successfully developed over 100 carbon projects in China, especially for NBS projects, including validation and verification under CDM, GS and VCS standard, such as VCS2082, 2310,1865 etc total 12 afforestation projects and VCS2362, 2476, etc over 10 agriculture projects . The experience in developing and implementing NBS projects will help project proponent to ramp up the capability of project implementing and management.
","The project is located in a typical karst rocky desertification area where debris flow, landslide and other disasters are quite common and biodiversity is at stake. The increasingly serious rocky desertification will restrict the sustainable development of the region and make the region poorer, so the afforestation and reconstruction of the green ecosystem has become the key issue. The local government and the forestry bureau started relevant research work in 2014 and prepared for the project. 

The species of ecological forest in the karst area mainly include Pine, China fir, Cypress, which are the main forest species to control karst rocky desertification in Guizhou, due to their fast growth, shallow rooting and strong adaptability to the soil. By implement afforestation activity through scientific and reasonable configuration method with no burning and slash, when planted above trees gradually grow up to the forest, project sites will gradually become ecological communities with the domain species of tall trees, and it will improve the biodiversity.

According to the reported barren mountain area data, the forestry departments at all levels have made counting and verification on the afforestation area. Finally, according to the counted planting area, the investment scale of this project is 1,855,144,620CNY, of which the total funds of governments at all levels is 1,298,601,234CNY, the remaining 556,543,386CNY was raised by the proponent of the project. 

Before the project started, the village committees conducted a survey of the local villagers  willingness to plant trees.  All the villagers agreed to use the barren lands collectively owned by the villages to plant trees in the end. Guizhou Xinzhanxin Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. has been fully authorized by all the village committees to act as the project owner and proponent. In September 2014, the project participant and Zunyi Forest Bureau held a consultant meeting with local village committees, and the main purpose of the meeting was to identify the stakeholders in the project. Stakeholders have taken carbon revenue seriously and believed that carbon benefits help break down economic barriers. Guizhou Xinzhanxin signed a carbon sequestration development agreement with the village committee to handle relevant matters, they will use the carbon revenue for the continuous management and maintenance of the forest.

Search Co2(Shanghai) Environmental Science & Technology Co. Ltd,No,Adjusted water management in rice paddies to reduce methane emissions,Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Pinghu District,Other (please specify),,Improved Cropland Management,,"This project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Yuhang District, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, which is one of the major rice-producing provinces in China. Rice was cultivated with continuously flooded water regime before the project implementation because there is no full-equipped irrigation system and farmers lack advanced techniques of water management -- intermittent flooded method. The implementation of this project activity is expected to generate about 60,000 tCO2e per year. This project is planned to be certified under VCS, so it will be delivered as VCUs. 
The ownership of the rice paddies of the agricultural land management project belongs to the farmers, which has been confirmed by the local government and agricultural bureau. Since these rice paddies are all legal agricultural fields, and the ownership is clear, there is no dispute over land ownership in the project site. 
In 2017, the government proposed to build higher standard ditches and reservoirs in rice paddies. Although the government would pay for all the materials, the farmers have to pay for employment fee during construction. However, most farmers cannot afford it, which had delayed the project. At the same time, Search CO2 (Shanghai) Environmental Science & Technology Co. Ltd sought to promote intermittent flooded method to reduce methane emissions in rice paddies while maintaining rice yields. Therefore, Search CO2 and farmers signed a rice carbon emission reduction project cooperation agreement, agreed that Search CO2 paid employment fee for famers, while these farmers authorized Search CO2 as a representative of the carbon project owner and Search CO2 only has the right to make decisions about the carbon reduction project. 
Since Search CO2, as the project proponent, has already paid in advance, and the project has been running for three and a half years, Microsoft s payments for CDR would be used for validation, verification, VCUs issuance, monitoring, etc. to keep continuation of the project. 
","Management Structure:
As mentioned above, Search CO2 and farmers signed a rice carbon emission reduction project cooperation agreement, in which farmers authorized Search CO2 as a representative of the carbon project owner to implement the project management and operation. Search CO2 works with local agricultural bureau and China National Rice Research Institute (CRRI) made up the management structure.
The technicians from local agricultural bureau and experts from China National Rice Research Institute are the emission reduction measurement providers. The local agricultural bureau provides technical advice and training to technicians and technicians measure the actual greenhouse gas reductions from proposed project activities. 
Management capacity:
Search CO2 (Shanghai) Environmental Science & Technology Co. Ltd was established in 2018 and focuses on the carbon development and transaction, it has successfully won approval for the world s first rice emission reduction project (VCS2362). Its team has relevant experience in developing and implementing Natural-Based Solutions type projects to develop and manage the project. 
The local agricultural bureau is the competent department of local agriculture, with expertise and authority in agricultural production activities. The technicians they provided are trained, skilled and experienced in rice cultivation to ensure the proper implementation of intermittent flooded method. 
China National Rice Research Institute (CRRI) is a national multi-disciplinary research institute with rice as its main research object. They have made significant progress in the related filed of how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation. The experts they provided have rich experience in measuring methane emissions from rice paddies so that to ensure the carbon benefits generated from this project.
","Before the project implemented, farmers cultivated rice with continuously flooded method since the controllable ditches and reservoirs were lacking, which means fields have standing water throughout the rice cropping season and may only dry out for harvest. However, the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition. In contrast, there are at least once aeration period of more than three days, except for end-season drainage, during the cropping season by conducting intermittently flooded method after the cement ditches is built in this project activity. Since the CH4 in rice paddies is produced by the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter after the flooding, allowing the field to drain halts CH4 production, which happens in anaerobic condition, reducing the total quantity of CH4 released during the cropping season. Moreover, the intermittently flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded.
In 2017, the government proposed to build higher standard ditches and reservoirs in rice paddies. Although the government would pay for all the materials, the farmers have to pay for employment fee during construction. However, most farmers cannot afford it, which had delayed the project. At the same time, Search CO2 (Shanghai) Environmental Science & Technology Co.

Three replicated closed chambers were set in each reference field to do the gas sampling. Then, all the samples were sent to do laboratory analysis by FID. Lastly, the methane emission rate would be gained, which can be used to calculate the amount of emission reduction.",Yes,Verra (VCS),,N/A,,,Yes,,"1)	Potential Risk 1: During the operation, if the cement ditches and reservoirs were badly damaged without long-term maintenance, intermittent flooded water regime cannot be implemented, reducing the expected volume of emission reductions.
Mitigation: Since each technician is in charge of several villages, farmers could immediately call the technician if a ditch broke down in their fields. If it is a minor problem, including a blocked water outlet, the technician shall be on site within an hour to solve it. If the technician cannot solve the problem, they should immediately inform Search CO2 and contact the local agricultural bureau to activate the emergency mechanism and take corresponding measures. For example, if the ditch is broken or leaking, the repair shall be arranged within 24 hours.
2)	Potential Risk 2: During the operation, if farmers cannot practice intermittent flooded water regime seriously, the amount of methane emission reduction could be reduced. 
Mitigation: Firstly, the farmers would be trained for intermittent flooded method every year. Moreover, Search CO2 had made a detailed monitoring plan. For the monitoring procedures of emission reduction, it consists of two parts. The first part is monitoring farmers  compliance with project cultivation practice. In order to determine whether the project fields are cultivated according to intermittent flooded cultivation practice, and thus assure that measurements on the reference fields are representative for the emissions from the project fields, a cultivation logbook shall be maintained for all project fields.  The technicians are required to check the logbooks every month to confirm that the records are consistent with intermittent irrigation and the actual situation. The technician will collect the logbooks every year before the verification, then the expert will check the contents in the logbooks before submit it to Search CO2 for final check.

As the above risk prevention and control mechanism has been made by Search CO2, no risks have occurred during the operation of this project in the past three years. ",30,30,"In the Acceptance Report of Project, the longevity of the ditches and reservoirs constructed to conduct the intermittent flooded method is 30 years. In addition, the crediting period of this project is 21 years. During the crediting period, farmers are required to continue practicing the management according to the carbon emission reduction project cooperation agreement signed between farmers and the project proponent.  ","Fire, pests and disease outbreaks The technicians who were hired by the project proponent and the local agricultural bureau will regularly inspect and maintain the rice paddies. If there are any fire, pests and disease outbreaks and extreme weather happened to threaten the rice and cause the reversal, the technicians will inform project proponent and local agricultural bureau.
If there is reversal happens, Searchco2 will report to the buyer, furthermore there is buffer pool set up for compensation.
","Mitigation
1)	Fire
According to the Law of the People's Republic of China on prevention and Control of Air Pollution, rice straw burning is strictly prohibited. Therefore, fire do not break out easily.
2)	Pests and disease outbreaks
Upon routine overseeing, the diseases will be treated immediately by biological control once occurred. The chemical pesticides are allowed to be used only if there is a serious pest problem erupted in the project area. The project proponent is experienced in local natural risk control with the help of experts from local agricultural bureau.

"South Pole USA, Inc.",Yes,Climate change mitigation project through humus development,CarboCert for living soils,Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"The project, implemented jointly by South Pole and CarboCert GmbH, works with arable farmers in Germany supporting the transition from conventional to regenerative agriculture practices. The purpose of the project is to incentivize farmers with financial rewards for sustainable farming practice change that results in greenhouse gas removals. 
 
Arable land accounts for approximately 28% of the world's 4,924 million hectares of land used for agriculture and is defined as land that is cultivated (ploughed or tilled) regularly, generally under a system of crop rotation. Arable land is being lost at a rate of over 10 million ha per year because of over-intensive farming, resulting in depletion of nutrients and soil erosion. Furthermore, intensive agriculture has caused arable soils to release a significant proportion of their organic carbon to the atmosphere. 
 
Regenerative agriculture can be defined as farming and grazing practices that reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring degraded soil biodiversity, resulting in both carbon drawdown and improving the water cycle. Regenerative agriculture differentiates itself from other sustainable agriculture practices by focusing on more than just the reduction of negative impacts of farming practices and instead ensures that agriculture has a net positive effect on environmental issues, including but not limited to:
â—�	reducing soil disturbance (tillage);
â—�	reducing synthetic inputs (pesticides and fertilisers);
â—�	maximising soil coverage over time with living roots;
â—�	maximising the functional role of biodiversity (moving beyond monocultures, livestock integration);
â—�	adapting design to local context.
 
Beyond climate change mitigation, the project stands to deliver a number of social and environmental co-benefits. These include increased resilience of farm livelihoods to flooding and drought, reduced soil erosion and associated leaching of nutrients, reduced use of chemical pesticides and associated impacts on biodiversity, increased natural fertility of farmland soil and the possibility of growing more nutrient-dense food.
 
However, farmers face several barriers that prevent them from transitioning to regenerative agriculture practices at a large-scale. First, since practice change can involve additional operational costs and can reduce yields, farmers fear an economic loss during their transition. Second, farmers currently see little market incentive that rewards them for taking the risk of transition. Third, since regenerative practices often involve innovation, a lack of confidence in alternative practices and their financial success is another barrier for farmers. In order to address these challenges, farmers require additional support, which can be obtained through climate finance.

FarmFacts
 Service Provider 
Service providers are accredited entities contracted to collect soil samples from farmers under a streamlined approach and analyse these in ISO-accredited laboratories. FarmFacts thereby helps to determine in-situ results by monitoring farm-specific baselines and captures subsequent increases in soil organic matter.

Farmers
Individual farmers will implement changes to their conventional practices in line with agronomic advice, technical- and methodological requirements.


Intended users
Stakeholders of the project, such as the buyers of ISO certificates, the participating farmers, CarboCert and South Pole.

","CarboCert was founded in 2016 and has developed the humus project as an independent agronomy firm headquartered in Germany. CarboCert s mission is to offer additional income to farmers to enhance sustainable soil management and to create diversity and enhance biodiversity. To deliver this mission, a team of experts in the science of soil management and crop production was put together with farmers and practitioners having extensive experience of direct farm management and advisory experience. 
Through direct relationships or gatekeeper organisations, CarboCert has formed partnerships with a number of farmers and cooperatives throughout Southern Germany, who share an interest in CarboCert s vision of a sustainable agriculture that nourishes people and nature. CarboCert led the design and delivery of the project, including the development of a monitoring protocol for farmers. Throughout the continuation of the project, individual farmers will be invited to enroll in the program to participate and contribute to increased soil organic carbon (SOC) levels.
 
The lifetime of the project is envisioned to be 30 years, during which farmers can enroll in 15-year crediting periods, followed by a five-year retention period for each farm, starting on the 1st of January 2017. The IPCC advises that mineral soils can continue to sequester carbon after practice change on average for 20 years. To allow for a program enrollment of farmers over ten years and ensure their participation for 20 years, 30 years has been defined as the project duration. This indicates that: 
â—�	enrollment of farmers can commence every year until 31.12.2026;
â—�	the beginning of the crediting period is represented by the initial soil sampling time;
â—�	reporting is undertaken in alignment with the project s monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) for each farm;
â—�	During the crediting period of 15 years, farmers can individually decide to sample enrolled plots in order to issue verified emission reductions and removals (VERRs);
â—�	the end of the crediting period is defined by a mandatory sampling 15 years after enrollment;
â—�	the end of the retention period is defined by a mandatory sampling 20 years after enrollment.
 
The requirement for landowners and tenants to commit to a five-year retention period after the crediting period, is necessary to ensure that farmers demonstrate that they have the ability to deliver the commitment to no loss events. The longer participation timeframe for farmers will work as a continued incentive to transform traditional production regimes and maintain regenerative practices. 
 
The project uses a results-based soil sampling approach, which has been co-developed by CarboCert and South Pole for the quantification of changes to net soil organic carbon (SOC) balance. FarmFacts was selected as a service provider to support sampling processes due to their extensive infrastructure distribution throughout Germany, facilitating regional access to farms. FarmFacts is a dedicated service provider accredited against the relevant ISO-norms, which ensures an independent sampling process backed up by a sound quality management process to avoid sampling errors. The baseline sampling process consists of a mix-sample taken from 25 individual samples with the help of hydraulic machinery, distributed over the area of interest by applying a specific pattern (Z-form). These sampled data points are georeferenced with guaranteed proximity of 1sqm2 (up to 2cm) to ensure maximum data accuracy when comparing the baseline SOC stocks with the SOC composition during the verification sampling. After the collection, the samples are tracked throughout the logistic structure and then sent to a DIN EN certified laboratory for analysis of the nutrient ratio and humus content. All data and documentation of the sampling process is uploaded into a shared cloud with CarboCert for easy access and information exchange between both parties. The results will be recorded in a centralised database managed by CarboCert to inform farmers on the impact of their practices over the previous years.

The project aims at enrolling farmers who are committed to implement humus-building practices. The following practices are applied to reduce agricultural emissions and increase storage of carbon in soil organic matter (SOM):
Reduced mechanical and chemical soil disturbances: Lowered/avoided tilling and reduced fertilization with synthetic fertilizers
Maintenance of a positive soil nutrient balance informed by recurring soil analysis
Increase of cover crops to ensure that soils remain protected from heavy precipitation events, strong winds and storms as well as droughts to avoid loss of irreplaceable fertile topsoil
Enhancing soil and plant biodiversity by undersowing multiple crop types and avoiding monocultures
Planting root crops, which are maintained to enhance soil microbes and biological exchange processes
Avoidance of putrefactive products and anaerobic fertilizer products
Mob grazing of sheeps to increase soil fertility
Fallow areas
Micro-nutrient distribution
 
The static baseline scenario assumes the continuation of the agricultural management practices prior to the farmer s enrollment, which are, for the majority of farmers, conventional agricultural practices and are deemed to have led to the existing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The methodologies for determining an individual farmer s baseline emissions are based on the initial soil sampling process, which determines the starting point for the static baseline. This is based on the conservative assumption that SOC stocks are declining due to current soil management practices within Germany and the wider EU. On-farm fuel use is not taken into account in this project due to the fact that the fuel consumption is generally expected to decline with the implementation of regenerative agriculture. Excluding these factors contributes further to the conservativeness of the project.
 
While additional climate action benefits from regenerative agriculture are expected, i.e. reduced agrochemical inputs and/or fuel consumption, the project solely focuses on the increased soil organic carbon enhancements. Subsequently, only removal credits are monitored and no emission reductions/avoided emissions are included. 
",Yes,Other (please specify),ISO ” (the potential to transition to VCS is under exploration),n/a,,,Yes,,"Agricultural projects face several inherent risks that may affect the performance of a farm.  Performance risk  is defined here as any risk that would lead to lower GHG enhanced removals than was envisaged by an individual farmer. The three most important risks identified include financial viability, alternatives to project activities appear more attractive to farm operators, and landowner and tenant commitment.
 
1. Financial Viability: Farmers find that implementing the project activities is not financially viable for them over the duration of the project, meaning that they do not follow their Management Plans and deliver sub-optimal outcomes.
Risk Management Measure - As a condition of participation in the project, farmers must confirm that they have access to suitable expert agronomic advice. Farmers will receive supporting documentation by CarboCert. As such, the risk that farmers undertake financially imprudent practice change given their local circumstances, is reduced.
 
2. Alternatives to project activities appear more attractive to farm operators: Conventional farming practices are common practice in the project region. During the project, some farm operators may perceive these conventional practices to be more desirable and consequently, withdraw from the project.
Risk Management Measure - Farmers are committed through their payments for soil sampling to continue the management approach. Furthermore, withholding 20% of the addressed pay-out until the completion of the retention period ensures that reversal to conventional farming will not occur. Finally, 20% of all VERRs generated will be held in the pooled buffer for 5 years and only sold if the subsequent verification sampling has shown that the farmer in question has not been at risk of causing a loss event during the retention.
 
3. Landowner and tenant commitment: The farm operator is a landowner or tenant and they, or their landowner if a tenant, decide to withdraw their land from the project during the crediting or retention period.
Risk Management Measure - Upon enrollment, farm operators who are landowners will be required to sign a contract for the entire duration of the crediting and retention period. The contract shall clearly state that, should a farm operator withdraw from the project during the crediting or retention period, they will no longer have a claim on future financial benefits and provided payments must be reimbursed. In the scenario where the tenant decides to withdraw, the risk management measure is the same as above. In order to manage the risk that the landowner decides to withdraw, information about the years left on the tenancy is required from all tenant farmers prior to enrollment.
 
Please refer to p.19-20 of the PDD for 4 other performance risks related to the project and associated risk management measures. 
",20,20,"The period comprises the same 20 years in both cases. Monitoring is done until the end of the retention period, after which, if sequestered carbon remains untouched in the soil, the 20% buffer withheld is paid out.

The durability term is taken as conservative as possible and only guaranteed over the project duration, meaning maximum 20 years per farm. Farmers are committed through their payments for soil sampling to continue the management approach and are also incentivized through CO2 credit sales to continue with regenerative agricultural practices. Withholding 20% of the addressed pay-out until the completion of the retention period ensures that reversal to conventional farming will not occur. This 20% of all verified emission reductions and removals (VERRs) generated will be held in the pooled buffer for 5 years and only sold if the subsequent verification sampling has shown that the farmer in question has not been at risk of causing a loss event during the retention.

","We define reversals as when carbon that is stored by a project is re-released into the atmosphere by either avoidable (i.e., intentional) or unavoidable (i.e., extreme weather) events. Under the collaboration with South Pole, CarboCert is responsible to regularly monitor the sequestered carbon in the soil. In case of any avoidable or unavoidable reversals, the farmer will only receive 80% of the potential income. The respective compensation will be logged in a database and will be released upon successful verification of the maintenance of carbon stocks throughout the retention period. Should a self-inflicted loss event be confirmed before the first or second verification event (during the crediting period), the farmer will not be compensated at all for expenses (soil sampling) and no certificates will be issued. This way, buyers will not directly be alerted to reversals, apart from the fact that the final 20% of all VERRs are not sold. This approach prevents buyers from being exposed to reversal risks, because project stakeholders are duly incentivized to ensure project integrity. 
","The 3 discussed performance risks discussed above are also relevant here. For brevity, I ve highlighted three natural risks to permanence below with specific mitigation measures. 
 
1. Pests and disease outbreaks: A pest or disease outbreak destroys a crop, affecting the biomass growth in a particular year and its contribution to enhanced removals. 
Risk Management Measure - Participating farmers will be provided with suitable advice through CarboCert in case of a relevant pest and disease outbreak. 
 
2. Extreme weather: Too much or too little rainfall leads to problems establishing or growing crops, respectively, affecting the biomass growth in a particular year and its contribution to enhanced removals. 
Risk Management Measure - Participating farmers will be provided with suitable advice through CarboCert in case of a relevant extreme weather event. 
 
3. Geological events: Earthquakes or other geological instabilities render farmland unworkable. 
Risk Management Measure - This is not deemed a material risk in Germany, where the project is located.
 
Non-Permanence Risk Management Plan
If a loss event occurred during the crediting period, at the next verification, a final calculation of the farm s soil removals will be performed and an assessment made as to whether a loss event has occurred and, if so, the quantified extent of the loss. Based on the project s monitoring and reporting procedures, no credits will be issued in case of reduced carbon stocks.
 
ISO does not prescribe specific management measures for dealing with non-permanence risk. However, the project has decided to implement a buffer system to ensure that farmers are incentivised to maintain the carbon stocks and that inaccuracies of the first verification are not leading to overissued credits. In terms of contributions to the buffer, the project aims to align with the VCS from Verra and other relevant standards, such as the UK s Woodland Carbon Code and the Label Bas-Carbone. Therefore, it applies a standard requirement that 20% of all VERRs generated in the project are held in a pooled buffer. Hence, at each verification, when the generated VERRs are verified, 20% of each farmer s VERRs will be set aside and reserved in the project s pooled buffer and used to account for any reversals. These VERRs will not be sold and/or retired until five years after the crediting period when they were created, provided ongoing monitoring by the second verification sample has shown that the farmer in question has not been at risk of causing a loss event during the retention period. A standardised contribution to the buffer for all farmers was selected instead of a customised contribution, based on individual risk assessments to control setup costs and based on the experience of other projects. As a result, the farmer will only receive 80% of the potential income. The respective compensation will be logged in a database and will be released upon successful verification of the maintenance of carbon stocks throughout the retention period. Should a self-inflicted loss event be confirmed before the first or second verification event (during the crediting period), the farmer will not be compensated at all for expenses (soil sampling) and no certificates will be issued.
 
In addition, other measures to manage non-permanence risk include: (i) CarboCert reserves the right to terminate a farmer s participation in the project at its own discretion following a loss event during the crediting period; and (ii) if a farmer causes a loss during the retention period, their re-enrolment in the project shall be terminated. Since sampling costs are borne by the farmers, this represents an economic loss for the farmer, since sampling costs might not be reclaimed.
 
As a final risk management measure, the contract signed by the farm operator will indicate that the right to payments generated by the sale of certificates from the buffer will specifically accrue to the operator of that land. Thus, if the land happens to be sold during the project s retention period, the seller can incorporate the value of the remaining payments into the price of that land. Selling this right to the new owner increases the likelihood that loss events will be avoided, which is an important mechanism in further ensuring non-permanence risks are minimised.","Conservatively, 20% of all VERRs generated by the project are held in a pooled buffer to compensate for any unavoidable reversals. Should a self-inflicted loss (avoidable) event be confirmed before the first or second verification event (during the crediting period), the farmer will not be compensated at all for expenses (soil sampling) and no certificates will be issued. For avoidable reversals during the retention period, similarly the withheld 20% will not be compensated. In addition to the buffer pool, this project implements safeguards to prevent reversals as illustrated in the above question. 
 
Carbon credits are only issued once an independent auditor verifies the carbon impact of the project. Therefore, any interim figures on estimated carbon removal or avoidance (such as the figures in a PDD) are temporary. Only verified carbon sequestration is delivered in the form of carbon credits that are sold to clients (i.e. ex-post credits meaning that the sequestration took place). If a carbon credit amount for this project that totals less than South Pole s submission were available because of an unforeseeable cause, we can deliver the shortfall from a similar project if that appeals to all relevant parties.
 
In the event you require marketing or communications support because of a carbon offset project you purchased from South Pole, our team has a dedicated response strategy we can deploy on Microsoft s behalf.
","A standard requirement applies that 20% of all VERRs generated in the project are held in a pooled buffer. Hence, at each verification, when the generated VERRs are verified, 20% of each farmer s VERRs will be set aside and reserved in the project s pooled buffer and used to account for any reversals. These VERRs will not be sold and/or retired until five years after the crediting period when they were created, provided ongoing monitoring by the 2nd verification sample has shown that the farmer in question has not been at risk of causing a loss event during the retention period. A standardised contribution to the buffer for all farmers was selected instead of a customised contribution, based on individual risk assessments to control setup costs and based on the experience of other projects. 
 
The pool consists only of CarboCert credits and considers only removal tons.
",20%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Since the project is running until 31.12.2046 (offtake over a total project duration of 30 years), a multi-year contract over the ongoing timeframe of 25 years could be considered, as could terms of 1-5 and 5-10 years. Minimum and maximum annual volumes still have to be determined. There is also the possibility of Microsoft directly investing in the project to support scaling it up.
","Due to improving market conditions and increasing demand/obligations for greenhouse gas emission compensation, prices per ton of CO2 is likely to increase in the future. 
 
Purchased credits can be delivered on an annual basis. 

Within shorter deal tenures prices can be held more constantly, with perhaps basic cost appreciation curves, an average price/tonne across the deal tenure. 

For longer deal tenures, prices will require a greater degree of variability given the above market trends, which are expected only to escalate.

Something still to be discussed between South Pole and Microsoft is the order of magnitude that the project could scale to, should Microsoft invest to scale up the project. This would likely affect cost/tonne in a positive way for Microsoft, but requires further deliberation by all parties. ","The project uses a results-based soil sampling approach, which has been defined by FarmFacts and certified against international standards for soil sampling and analysis according to DIN EN 15936, 16168 and others. FarmFacts was selected as a service provider to support sampling processes due to their extensive infrastructure distribution throughout Germany, facilitating regional access to farms. FarmFacts is a dedicated service provider with ISO accreditation, which ensures an independent sampling process backed up by a sound quality management process to avoid sampling errors. The baseline sampling process consists of a mix-sample taken from 25 individual samples with the help of hydraulic machinery and distributed over the area of interest by applying a specific pattern (Z-form).

After the collection, the samples are tracked throughout the logistic structure and then sent to a DIN EN certified laboratory for analysis of the nutrient ratio and humus content. All data and documentation of the sampling process is uploaded into a shared cloud with CarboCert for easy access and information exchange between both parties. The results will be recorded in a centralised database managed by CarboCert to inform farmers on the impact of their practices over the previous years. 

Regarding the question of hectares below: Over the last 5 years since the project initiation on the 1st of January 2017, 300+ farmers have enrolled with an area of about 14,000 hectares. Since farmers can enroll another 5 years (10 years total) until the 31st of December 2026, a similar amount is expected to be enrolled in the upcoming time period.

And regarding the sequestration rate questions below: 

Sequestration rate: The first control sample indicated an average of 3 tCO2e/ha/yr as a conservative assumption for the annual sequestration rate. Preliminary results from the participating farms however showed up to 7 tCO2e/ha/yr after the first resampling period. Since SOC levels are expected to decrease over time due to SOC oversaturation of the humus, the conservative number was taken as an estimation over the total project duration.

Rate change over time: Yes, a rate change over time is considered (as mentioned above) but neglected since sequestration rates (higher at the beginning / lower at the end) are expected to average out - hence a conservative number of 3 tCO2e/ha/yr
 


",14000,3,0,"Alongside the climate change mitigation benefits of these farming practice changes, the project offers numerous other co-benefits as well, such as:
â—�	increased resilience of farmland to flooding and drought, by enabling the soil structure to develop in such a way that it absorbs and stores more water (climate resilience);
â—�	reduced soil erosion and associated leaching of nutrients and inputs (climate resilience, ecosystem protection);
â—�	reduced use of synthetic pesticides and associated impacts on biodiversity (ecosystem protection);
â—�	increased natural fertility of farmland soil (ecosystem protection);
â—�	long-term, the possibility of growing more nutrient-dense food (social equity and justice).
","Undisturbed soil improves soil biology and structure which reduces loss from erosion and nutrient and pesticide run-off. Improving soil biology, increases resilience to crop stressors, improvements in plant health, and yield. The increase in organic food demand consequently has a positive effect on all of society. Farmers transition towards more costly regenerative practices as demand and thus food prices rise. Increased yields effectively reduce cost-centered market competition. Consumers increasingly pay more for nutrient-dense food with positive environmental effects. This shift creates a healthier, more vibrant society with improved social equity and greater resilience to future changes and fatter farmer pockets.","A specific environmental impact assessment has not been conducted for the project. Nevertheless, South Pole has identified only positive environmental and socio-economic impacts of the project. Since the project enables the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, it is not expected to have negative impacts on local stakeholders, communities or the surrounding environment in general. For instance, a reduction in synthetic fertiliser and pesticide use will lead to less air and groundwater pollution for surrounding communities. This effectively reduces short- and long-term costs for ecologically-harmful products and their impacts, which can instead be invested in practices that will improve social equity and environmental justice (e.g. by not degrading fertile land in the first place). A reduction of these impacts in addition to reliable and qualitative yields from regenerative practices can thus also lead to a better quality of life for farmers themselves and to pass on to future generations.
 
","The only potential environmental impacts are related to possible leakage. 
A common concern regarding agricultural projects and leakage is that the introduction of alternative farming practices will result in lower yields. Since food demand continues to grow, the concern is that such projects would displace food production to other areas, potentially leading to increased GHG emissions. In reality, there are many long-term experiments that demonstrate the capacity of improved crop rotations and cover crop adoption to increase SOM levels, while maintaining or increasing yields, without requiring additional nitrogen inputs compared to conventional management.
In this project, one of the other theoretical sources of leakage is the substitution of synthetic for organic fertiliser. From a single farm point of view, this results in an increased demand for organic manure. In theory, it is technically possible that this could result in an increase in the production of farmyard manure in response, via expansion of livestock activities. If this were the case, it would result in increased GHG emissions from livestock. In practice, manure is a waste product from livestock production whose value is immaterial to a livestock producer compared to the value of meat or livestock products. The other possible effect is that manure could be diverted from other activities that are more beneficial to the climate. In Europe, the vast majority of manure is used to fertilise farmland, rather than used in bioenergy for example, so this is also not considered to be a material risk.
A possible market dynamic leakage component for this project is fertilisers. Synthetic nitrogen fertilisers are being replaced by organic fertilisers and the use of cover crops. Depending on the volumes of synthetic fertilisers being avoided, it is theoretically possible that the project could lead to a reduction in price for such fertilisers and subsequently an increased consumption by other farmers (i.e. a  rebound effect ). However, the synthetic fertiliser market is a global commodity market. In the EU alone, there were over 10 million different farms in 2016. So, the behaviour of all currently enrolled farmers in this project is highly unlikely to have a material impact on fertiliser pricing. The risk of leakage via this mechanism is therefore negligible.

Carbon Direct have recently conducted an in-depth study of Standard Gas around Carbon Removal/Negativity of its process and hope they remain involved as project progresses ","The founding goal of Standard Gas was to provide a cleaner disposal route for non-recyclable waste than either landfill or incineration (Waste Diversion). 

The founding team at Standard Gas comprised a group of Real Estate professionals who identified the need both for a greener solution to the built environment and the need for increased socially affordable housing. The opportunity to remediate closed UK landfill sites was identified as a solution for affordable housing development and the founders funded an engineering group to develop a small-scale, modular technology based on the principles of fast pyrolysis. In doing so, the remediation of landfill sites would see the harnessing of the rich resources therein.  

After achieving unique End of Waste certification in UK on its syngas (at least as clean as natural gas) and demonstrating that solid carbon char was captured from all the many feedstocks treated (in varying quantities) from biomass/demolition wood waste through to hazardous and oily/plastic wastes, the management team have assembled a world class supply chain /engineering delivery team to deploy units at scale in UK and globally. 

As the technology evolved its suitability for decarbonizing both technology sector and the hard-to-abate industries was recognized, and the scope of the company broadened beyond its initial ambitions to become a profitable solution to decarbonize energy & Industry.  

Conversations began with CO&I and CELA  in 2020 to provide Carbon negative clean energy to Datacenters in UK and potential Carbon removal and avoidance for CELA

For the conversion factor we use the lowest number, which is for Landfill.   All calculations are proprietary but  compiled in accordance with ISO 14064 and verified by the likes of South Pole LLP. 

The CDR is accurately calculated by actual weight of carbon char and testing of said char",No,No certification,,N/A,"Methodology of our process yet to be specified by the majors certifiers, however South Pole LLP after several months working with the team and studying methodology , assure Standard Gas that we would be applicable for most, if not all, the major certifiers.  

Please see previous sheet for exact working on Life Cycle emissions calculations.  Carbon Direct have also looked at this modelling - done in accordance GHG protocol and  ISO 14064  -  and we believe they are comfortable in its net negativity.  

With this in mind we feel Certification with existing majors it's not needed quite yet, and instead we are developing our own along the lines of the BiCRS methodology to create a new premium removal certificate. 

SG are working on a detailed report to charaterize the char from each of the major types of waste our process can treat, showing the Carbon oxygen ratio, strength, particulate size and potential so that building firms can access a stability report on each type of char /use for replacing fossil fuel based components.  We are working closely on this with National University of Singapore (and associated consultants) - arguably at the forefront of analysis  into char use in building materials. ",Please see the SG100 10MW carbon accounting spreadsheet (GHG Protocol) as well as South Pole Report (and hopefully an internal one from Carbon Direct too ),Yes,,"External Risks - Funding, Feedstock

SG believe the main risk is that the project doesn t get funded, and the related Carbon removal benefits never materialise.  That said, CIF are interested in funding 50% of a 10MWe project and these talks are reasonably advanced.  SG are imminently about to finalise a raise of the equity that relates to the manufacture of the requisite SG100s for the project. Once this achieved , we expect the additional project funding from CIF would allow SG to grow and roll out rapidly as sites and funding become more mainstream. 

For any waste management solution there is a risk of localized feedstock supply imbalance, however the flexibility of SG100 technology substantially mitigates this risk. Furthermore, LOIs with Waste brokers in UK are already in place and are desperate for non-burn UK based solutions, which save them from exporting such waste to Europe for incineration. 


Internal Risks  “ Technology

Technology is always a risk in such projects , even in  the delivery of mature technologies, however  by the time the SG100 is delivered to the host site it will have gone through a 500 hour factory assessment testing by the manufacturers, who have each agreed to withhold between 50-75% of the cost of the build until said factory assessment test (FAT) is successfully passed. 

Once that 500 hour FAT is complete, assuming the SG100 meets a 65% design capacity threshold (which the manufacturers are incentivised to ensure happens)  it has been offered a Performance Guarantee on the technology by the world s leading reinsurer - Munich Re. The project performance will be reliant on the efficiency and throughout of the SG100 technology and this will be insured. ",500,50,"As the studies in this area are relatively nascent we have no wish to be disingenuous . We would prefer not to ""guarantee"" anything but the figure given for this document is an estimate based on current scientific studies /reference papers/ consensus that are  suggesting far in excess of this number. 

We intend to sequester our carbon char in such things as asphalt and concrete - which the reference /science papers that we have studied are suggesting between 100- 500 years being an acceptable range for such sequestration.  It s believed 75 years would be an acceptable number for asphalt and much higher for concrete (as such the 50 years estimated should be conservative). 

SG are working with Hanson UK to do just this and replace fossil fuel based components and simultaneously working with York & Edinburgh Universities in UK and National University of Singapore to create a stability report that will detail each waste type and the strength /durability of the char from each.","We believe this to be almost impossible. Char will be sequestered in either asphalt or concrete.  Even if in extreme weather events buildings are destroyed etc , the char will be locked in the concrete and likely landfilled afterwards.","the risk of reversal are minimal of the char is co-mingled with concrete. There is a potential risk that once char created / captured that it does not make it into concrete, but if so the removal tonnage credit wouldn't be created ",N/A,N/A,N/A,Multi-year contract (offtake or similar) only,"
The ideal outcome long term is that we secure a contract with Microsoft that has a put and call option, so that as we develop more plants and create carbon char we can agree to sell a proportion of those removal tonnes created to Microsoft at a pre-agreed price or on a formula based system relating to the market price 

If SG100 performs as expected , then our rollout plan for the technology could rapidly create over a million tonnes a year as/when we start to produce methanated transport fuel","In a draft Heads of terms document relating to a 10MWe PPA for Microsoft , there is a clause input by CELA for c. 2000-3000 tonnes a year (of the 28,000 tonnes for the particular project) for 10 years 

As an incentive for CIF to assist in funding of that project , SG have suggested a 75% reduction on the Carbon pricing for the duration of 10 year tenure 

We would happily discuss additional /future deals if/when the roll out plans take shape",,,,,"Waste diversion, Carbon removal, climate impact , health benefits and multiple other UN SDGs 

","Each SG100 deployed can divert  48,000 tonnes of waste away from dumping grounds/ landfill or inefficient incineration. We can measure the specific tonnage of removal removal from this small-scale, easy to install and operate technology , but we can also point to GHG protocol and ISO Accredited analysis of Scope 1,2 &3 emissions savings that both South Pole LLP, Columbia University have verified and  Carbon Direct have also studied. Confirmation of Carbon removals & avoidance we will use BiCRS methodology and can provide specific reports related to this. ","For the initial project in the UK this is limited, however for future projects that could be built in developing or underdeveloped nations we believe there will be a number of significant benefits from helping clean environment by providing a direct replacement of coal burning to provide heat & power 

SG technology can create a win-win closed loop cycle in developing areas through both reducing the social and environmental impact of landfill plus producing on-site renewable energy for use or fuel, creating double sustainability impact for poor communities. 

SG technology can replace polluting incinerators, landfill and dumping grounds and help reduce illnesses & deaths from hazardous chemicals and pollution thereby improving environmental health & quality of life. 

SG has already started conversations on deployment to India, Indonesia, Guyana, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, South Africa & others on how we can clean the environment and support social improvements and welfare 

Clear impact for plastic removal from the oceans and the communities that would benefit 
","We do not envisage any negative environmental or scoial harms, actually quite the opposite. 

We foresee
 i.	Additional local employment will be generated at each site. 
ii.	Manufacturing of the SG100 units can be localized, thereby supporting job creation as well as sustainable industrialization innovation 
iii.	Training facilities are planned to meet required demands 
iv.      SG will assist in establishing local manufacturing partnerships, as well education & training to improve skill levels 
v.	Deployment of SG technology can divert the women and children from landfills /dumpsites, home to some if the poorest and sickest workers in the world and can be encouraged/supported to transfer to waste handling/monitoring roles. 
vi.	The concomitant health benefits of remediating these dumpsites, as well as water/sewage waste & sanitation

With specialist knowledge in the fields of organic residues, soil amendments, agricultural biofertilisers and smart irrigation, SUEZ will use the CarbonFXâ„¢ pyrolysis technology created by Airex Energy for the global development of industrial-scale production plants that transform residual lignocellulosic biomass (bark, sawdust, waste wood) into biochar, a stable carbon with high technical and environmental added value.
The conversion of all waste wood residues, from silviculture to the lumber and wood processing industries, into biochar enables the extension of the  carbon sink  effect of natural plant photosynthesis, which captures a quarter of global CO2 emissions annually. Promoting such sustaining residues recovery contributes also to better manage forestry domains and limit wildfires disasters.
Biochar is a viable solution to remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it in soils for several centuries. When used as a soil amendment, biochar improves plant growth and yields of urban and agricultural soils by enhancing water and nutrient retention, soil aeration and micro-organisms activity.

Developing biochar applications will contribute directly or indirectly to the following UN-SDG global indicators : 2-6-9-11-12-13-15-17","Twelve good reasons for using biochar (from EBI's white paper, 2020)
1. Biomass pyrolysis is a key technology for saving the climate (Werner et al, 2018; Woolf et al, 2010; Woolf et al, 2016)
2. The use of certified biochar has been proven to meet the highest environmental standards and, when used properly, is safe for soils, ecosystems and users (EBC, 2012; Lehmann & Joseph, 2015)
3. Pyrolysis can be used to close organic material cycles. This is a prerequisite for the principle of recycling in the bio-economy. (Woolf et al, 2016)
4. Biochar improves the water retention capacity of soils and, in combination with fertilizers, leads to yield increase and stabilization (Ye et al, 2020; Razzaghi et al, 2020)
5. Biochar helps to build up humus (Blanco-Canqui et al, 2020; Weng et al, 2018)
6. Biochar reduces GHG emissions from agriculture (Borchard et al, 2019; He et al, 2017; Liu et al, 2018)
7. Biochar reduces nitrate pollution of ground and surface water (Borchard et al, 2019)
8. Biochar shows multiple benefits in animal husbandry and improves animal health (Schmidt et al, 2019)
9. Biochar promotes tree growth and increases the stress resistance of urban trees (Embr n et al, 2016; FLL, 2017)
10. Biochar can be used as an additive in composting to improve compost quality and reduce nitrogen losses (Godlewska et al, 2017; Zhao et al, 2020)
11. Biochar can improve the properties of concrete and asphalt (Gupta & Kua, 2017)
12. Biochar enables the rehabilitation of contaminated soils (BMLFUW, 2017)","Our commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion rests on the principle that everyone deserves the freedom to bring their whole selves to work without fear of judgment or discrimination. Diversity has many forms, including, but not limited to, identity, thought, ethnic background, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, language, education and socio-economic realities.
We recognize the importance of the distinct experiences and perspectives our people bring to the workplace each and every day. Our differences are truly our strengths and we strive to create a work environment in which all individuals are treated fairly and with respect, have equal access to opportunities and resources.
When we decide to establish a new production plant, we make sure our workforce reflects the diversity of the community where we operate.

SUEZ INTERNATIONAL or its subsidiary,No,Organic waste recovery into compost for carbon sequestration in soils,SUEZ FRANCE COMPOST,Biomass conversion with carbon removal and storage (BiCRS) (including BECCS),,,,"SUEZ produces different types of composts from raw materials considered as waste.
Composting this organic waste is a way to significantly reduce GHG emissions compared to other solutions such as incineration or landfill.
Compost contains a certain amount of stabilized carbon and this can be enhanced accordingly to various processing conditions. It is used in agriculture as an organic amendment which improves soil fertility, biodiversity and water retention. It also contributes to carbon sequestration in the soil aligned with the 4/1000 initiative strategy.
Compost is also a source of mineral nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) and thus generates for end-users relevant avoided GHG emissions by reducing impacts (energy consumption, GHG direct emissions,  ¦) linked to the manufacture of chemical fertilizers. It also makes it possible to avoid the use of limited natural resources (petroleum, phosphate mines).
In order to increase the carbon content of the compost, as well as its stability (permanency), SUEZ improves the composting process in particular by adapting the sieving (mesh size), by increasing the size and the proportion of lignocellulosic part, by adding other ingredients like biochar from sludge.
In addition, SUEZ offers agronomic and environmental support to more precisely assess the proportion of carbon sequestered in agricultural soils.","The project will be managed by the Operations Support Department of Suez Organique, placed under the authority of the Managing Director of Suez Organique, a subsidiary of Suez. The following will be involved in the project: Production Department, TERRIAL, CIRSEE (SUEZ research center), AUREA Laboratory, PURO EARTH.

SUEZ R&D is already working on improving biofertilizers in the form of composts, as part of the 4/1000 initiative for maintaining soil fertility. Trials are underway with our research center (CIRSEE) to strengthen the agronomic and environmental quality of composts. A program called BIOFERTILIZER has been in operation for 4 years with the objectives of producing quality enriched composts and digestates.
Another program under development and which should be implemented in 2022 aims to reduce NOx and CH4 emissions from composting, emissions that are already low compared to alternative waste treatment methods.

 ¢ Preservation of resources, the environment and health 
 ¢ Sustainable and smart agriculture 

As part of the manufacture and use of composts in agriculture, various laboratory tests and tests are planned to measure and reduce GHG emissions. In particular, mixing tests with co-products are under discussion, as well as experiments aimed at optimizing aeration during the fermentation phase in particular. These various actions aim in the long term to maximize the value of the sequestrable compost and to better understand the conditions of carbon conservation in agricultural soils. 

The evaluation of potentially released carbon is based on models for calculating changes in organic matter in soils (models calibrated by experimental measurements in agricultural plots). In addition, monitoring of organic matter content in the soil can be organized through sampling and analyzes on control plots. ","The main risks are linked to the quality of the composts and the contexts in which they are used:
- Intentional or accidental exposure of the compost to combustion 
- Use of the compost in agricultural conditions that aren t in accordance with the uses recommendations

- Ecosystem protection  
- Climate resilience 
- Waste reduction 
- Water Management  ","The main co-benefits provided by the contributions of composts are in particular:
From an agronomic point of view:
- Savings in mineral fertilizers provided by farmers; depending on the waste treated, the compost can provide phosphorus, nitrogen and potash.
- A contribution to the biological diversity of soils and to the increased presence of earthworms in particular,
- An improvement in the water retention capacity of the soil,
- A reduction in erosion phenomena, in addition to other agronomic practices

In terms of waste treatment: local solution to limit GHG emissions and contribute to employment in rural areas.","The recovery of waste through composting is a local solution that promotes short circuits and involves local populations in the collection and treatment of their waste. For bio-waste and sanitation waste, specific collections are set up to optimize their recovery rate. For green waste, necessary for the production of high carbon sequestrable compost, voluntary collection points (waste reception centers) support selective collections and provide solutions for maximizing collection rates.

The composting of organic waste thus avoids illegal deposits and helps to secure their treatment.
Jobs are created at the composting sites. There are around 2 to 3 direct jobs for an installation of 10,000 t / year.
For farmers, having locally produced organic amendments allows them to have alternative resources complementary to chemical fertilizers.

As a perspective, in emerging economies markets (Africa for instance), composting is a sustainable way to improve organic waste management compared to landfilling still considered as the business as usual. Promoting such improved compost with positive Climate impact could help to expand composting in such areas and contribute to local inclusion and job creation. This could also expand significantly the sourcing footprint for buyers looking for such CDR solutions.","Organic amendments obtained by composting from organic waste contain undesirable substances such as heavy metals, organic compounds or pathogens, regardless of the waste treated. It is for this reason that very strict regulations have been put in place, whether at European level or at Member State level, in France in particular. Compliance with the threshold values is essential to continue using composts. In the event of non-compliance, the composts cannot be marketed and they must be disposed of. Various actions have been taken over the past 20 years to reduce the levels of harmful elements. For example, the ban on the use of lead in fuels has led to very significant reductions in the levels of this element in sanitation by-products.

Regarding the manufacture of composts, the mechanical devices used consume fossil fuels. However, consumption remains limited with regard to the quantities of waste treated. Actions taken by operators aim to reduce this consumption (eg optimization of loader operation, choice of low-consumption equipment, less energy-consuming composting methods).
 
Regarding NOx and CH4 emissions during the fermentation phases in particular, the commonly accepted values are generally low. However, Suez wanted to initiate a program to control and reduce these emissions. To do this, an R&D program will be initiated with our research center (CIRSEE) with the collaboration of INRAE (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment). The implementation of this program should be initiated at the end of 2021-beginning of 2022.",,,,,,

Our founder had worked with forestry for almost 20 years. With a BA degree in biology and a Msc in Forestry he had the most sincere approach to forestry with great concern regarding biodiversity and conservation, still using the forest for forestry. 

He had noticed that some forestry measures, like adding nutrients to young and middle ages stands, were not conducted due to the lack of economy to such an investment for the landowner. If this would happen it could have lots of quick positive effects on climate and lots of other benefits would eventually open up in the future. During the autumn of 2018 he investigated the potential of ""making it happen"". He found out that approximately 5-10% of Sweden's emission of GHG could be removed by the idea of adding nutrients where it would not happen without someone else paying for it. Approximately 10 % of Sweden's forest land would probably be ""additional"". 

He quit his position in forestry saying: ""1. IÂ´m going to help save the climate 2. I'm doing it together with great professional people. 3. In the market economy which I believe will be a great part of the solution. 4. IÂ´m an ordinary guy and need a salary every month. 5. Lets do it together!"" In 2019 he was joined by an investor and a lawyer with the right chemistry and skills. They founded The Forest Solution in october 2019. The curiosity and interest of major companies in Sweden were huge during late 2019 and Q1 of 2020. Then came the pandemic. Still we got our first customers in early 2020.

We wanted our customers to be sure that they got what they wanted. We asked them and the answer was of course, ""we need a certification"". 

This was not an easy task because we saw a lot of things that didn't impress us.

It all came out that we used the standard ISO 14064:2 (2019) and the GHG protocol to make a total GHG budget for our project. We use DNV to validate our PDD. They had the most competent validator as the former CEO of VCS. Late 2020 this ISO140464 validation was finished. Earlier that late summer of 2020 we did our first measures of adding nutrients to forests in central Sweden.

We have had interests from investors during the whole period but we wanted to find the best partnership if we should take in another partner. In early 2021 we saw the need of scaling up and to have more than only one employee. Two of Sweden's most important and influential  climate persons � in these aspects wanted to invest and also be a part of the operational team. Then former olympic champion i biathlon Bj rn Ferry and many times world champion i armwrestling Heidi Andersson joined the team. They are also well known for their TV program concerning advocating for transition to sustainable living.

"The Forestland Group, LLC",Yes,Working forest conservation in the Connecticut River headwaters of NH,The Forestland Group CT Lakes,Forestry (removal only),,,Improved Forest Management,"Connecticut Lakes is a 146,435-acre Improved Forest Management (IFM) project protecting the headwaters of the Connecticut River through sustainable forest management and habitat conservation. The project is in its 8th reporting year, therefore credits available from the project are largely carbon removals achieved through tree growth and a small portion of emissions reductions from carbon stored in long-term wood products through FSC-certified sustainable harvesting.  

TFG acquired this forestland in June 2009 and began the carbon offset project in July 2013. The property is one of the largest privately-owned, forested properties in the State of New Hampshire and has been managed by industrial forest owners for at least 60 years. Formerly owned by the International Paper Company, the CT Lakes property underwent a cooperative effort between the Trust for Public Land, Connecticut Lakes Realty Trust (CLRT), and the State of New Hampshire, resulting in a 25,000-acre Natural Area owned by the State of NH, a recreational plan, a road maintenance agreement, identified special management areas, and a working forest conservation easement. In June of 2009, CLRT was purchased by Heartwood Forestland Fund IV; managed by The Forestland Group, LLC. 

CT Lakes current forest management activities focus on increasing the overall carbon stocking through sustainable timber harvests designed to promote growth and quality of timber overtime. Timber harvests implement a variety of FSC-approved silvicultural methods including shelterwoods, small-patch clear cutting, and small-group selection harvests. Harvest practices go beyond FSC requirements to meet the sustainability requirements set out in the carbon program. The revenue from the carbon offsets allows for a more sustainable harvesting regime to continue, rather than more aggressive harvesting that would prevent continued forest growth, and therefore additional carbon capture removals.

The purposes of conservation easement include: the conservation of the productive forests on the Property; sustain traditional forest uses including forest management activities and permitted recreational activities; conserve water resources, biological diversity, fish and wildlife habitat, and rare plants and animals; conserve the unusual natural habitat type known as the  high elevation mountain spruce-fir forest � which supports rare animals and pockets of mature forest stands located above 2,700 feet in elevation; guarantee permitted public access to the Property to recreate in designated areas; and to retain property as an economically viable and sustainable tract of land, conducive to ownership by a private timberland owner or timberland investor for the production of timber, pulpwood and other forest products.
","TFG is an independent Timberland Investment Management Organization (TIMO) headquartered in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. TFG s regional offices are in the United States Southeast, Appalachia, Great Lakes, and the Northeast. We manage forests for a mix of institutional, foundation, endowment, and family office clients. The Connecticut Lakes Property is owned the Connecticut Lakes Realty Trust, a subsidiary of one of the funds in TFG s portfolio, Heartwood Forest Fund VI. The CT Lakes IFM project encompasses all of the forested acres on the property.  

Finite Carbon is the carbon offset project developer including project design, quantification, and carbon project monitoring. Landvest Timberland is the forestry consultant who conducted the inventory, on-site project monitoring, and also implements and oversees the sustainable forest management activities. 
","The project was listed in July 2013 and was developed under the 2011 ARB Compliance protocol with the support of project partners Finite Carbon and Landvest. TFG pays for all third-party expenses associated with the development and ongoing maintenance of the project. Finite Carbon is compensated through receipt of a portion of the credits developed in each reporting year, and Landvest is paid consultant management fees associated with their work on the carbon project. The project underwent verification, registration, and ARB approval in December of 2014. The second and third reporting periods (1/8/2014 - 1/7/2015 and 1/8/2015 - 1/7/2016) were verified and approved by ARB by December 2018.

Annual monitoring requirements assure the timely discovery, reporting, and recourse for any reversals.  ","Unintentional/unavoidable reversal risks include natural disaster, fire, pest, disease, etc. Intentional/avoidable risks include overharvesting, timber theft, or conversion to non-forested land uses. Sustainable timber management through FSC certification reduces the risk of overharvesting. Regular property monitoring and consultant relationship management through forest management activities reduces the risk of timber theft. The conservation easement prevents conversion to non-forest. Unavoidable risks are mitigated through maintaining a forest of diverse age, species, and structure through TFG s Natural Forest Management Principles. ","The Forestland Group will replace the credits from an intentional reversal through the purchase of removals from other projects.

Active sustainable forest management for timber, pulpwood and other forest products provides substantial employment opportunities and contributes to the forest products economy, a major component of the region s economy, for more than 100 years. The forest carbon project and sustainable natural forest management provides significant economic and health benefits to the communities locally and downstream of the property, and ensure they are not left behind in the transition to an environmentally just future.","TFG is committed to managing natural forest systems to mitigate climate change, drive positive ecological impacts, support rural economic resilience, and provide financial returns for investors. This project was designed to minimize negative impacts while maximizing the benefits of natural forest management. Natural forest management utilizes natural regeneration, which reduces the ecological and climate impact (including emissions) from planting or more intensive regeneration practices. Fossil fuel emissions from trucks and equipment used to monitor the property and carry out the sustainable forest management practices are undoubtedly less than a more traditional intensive forest management regime. Finally, maintaining the forest as a working forest preserves economic and employment opportunities in the community in comparison to a no-harvest preservation project. ",,,,,,
The Nature Conservancy,,Virginia Clinch Valley Conservation Forestry and Carbon Offset Program,Virginia Conservation Forestry Program – Tazewell Elk Garden,Improved forest management (removal only; not including avoided forest carbon loss),,,,"The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Clinch Valley Conservation Forestry Program is a pioneering effort, founded in 2002, to employ working forest management easements to protect large tracts of privately-held forests by implementing climate-smart forestry for positive economic and environmental returns. These managed forests cover 23,000 acres in the globally-important Clinch River Valley. The Clinch River itself is recognized worldwide for its incredible diversity of rare freshwater mussels and fish. The mountains and valleys that surround the river are a core part of one of North America’s most critical migratory corridors for plants and animals adjusting to a warming climate. The Clinch Valley is part of   Virginia’s coal country: an economically-challenged region of Central Appalachia going through a profound change due to the industry’s decline. Without TNC’s Clinch Conservation Forestry Program these forests would be vulnerable to clear-cutting and degradation by landowners who depend on these forests for income.  The program’s climate-smart forest management not only increases carbon sequestration in the forests of enrolled properties, it also and provides a stable source of income for participating landowners. They receive an annual payment from TNC, and in exchange, TNC maintains full control over how their forest is managed. Microsoft’s purchase of carbon credits from the program will help to support these management activities and landowner payments.  The program is led by two professional foresters who are supported by an aquatic scientist and a landscape ecologist/wildlife specialist. The lead forester, Greg Meade, has deep experience in successfully developing and implementing forest carbon projects and has been the lead on these carbon projects since their inception, including several verifications.  In addition to carbon project management, the team oversees all forest restoration activities, which include planning and implementing carefully designed commercial timber harvests, controlling invasive species, conducting non-commercial timber stand improvement practices, completing forest inventories and other ecological monitoring, leading field tours with other forestry professionals, and establishing exclusion fencing to protect sensitive caves and other native wildlife habitats from nearby livestock.  The team also maintains our program’s third-party certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (https://us.fsc.org/en-us).  Every enrolled property has permanent legal protection via conservation easement (or, in one case, The Nature Conservancy’s fee simple ownership).

Major conservation efforts have focused on Olympic National Park (a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve) and Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary, and also recognized wild salmon strongholds within the Quillayute, Hoh, Queets and Quinault Rivers.     The lowland areas of the Washington coast harbor its most productive forests and wild salmon streams. It is also the area most impacted by more than a century of industrial forest management with clear cut rotations that have degraded streams and almost eliminated some of the world’s most majestic old-growth forests. In response, we have launched a strategy that blends philanthropic capital and proceeds from carbon sales to support restoration efforts in the Olympic Rainforest and Willapa Bay creating conservation corridors from summit to sea.     Enormous amounts of carbon are sequestered when TNC acquires industrially managed timberland and uses improved forest management to restore old forest habitat and function along critical river corridors and salmon strongholds. However, as properties are brought into TNC’s management pool they are typically young and well below the regional carbon baseline. The carbon sequestration in these early years is uncompensated under current market conditions. Nevertheless, our existing portfolio of 22,855 acres of forestland has matured to stocking above baseline, and can now support our first carbon sale. We estimate that this first project will generate more than 2,900,000 credits over 20 years, including more than 2,100,000 credits that are attributable to removals only.    We plan to combine these sale proceeds with philanthropic contributions to ramp up our restoration activities and to launch new carbon offset projects across the entire coastal rainforest region, which we refer to as the Emerald Edge. The Emerald Edge is the largest coastal temperate rainforest remaining in the world, spanning 100 million acres from Alaska to Washington, and boasts water, fisheries, and timber that quite literally feed and house nations.

The Nature Conservancy and its partners are working to create that system through the use of remote sensing technology. Remote sensing technology is evolving at a furious pace, and there are now models that can estimate biomass at high resolution and accuracy. At a minimum, such technologies can track our collective progress towards sequestering carbon in biomass in furtherance of GHG reduction targets, but, more practically, these technologies can provide transparency and accountability as to whether any particular forest stand is being managed consistent with its sequestration commitments.     Within the context of carbon offset projects, in particular, the technology would drastically reduce the cost of project development and monitoring, and has the potential to fundamentally change market forces and the willingness of land managers to make commitments to sequester carbon. Currently, the development of a carbon offset project requires an initial forest carbon inventory and ongoing monitoring, both of which rely an intensive sampling process with field surveys conducted on plots every 5-10 acres. These inventory and monitoring costs often exceed 40% of the overall cost of project development, and are a major obstacle to the viability of carbon offset projects.    Recent technological advances indicate that it may be feasible to accurately monitor carbon stocks and GHG emissions at high resolution, over larger spatial scales and longer temporal scales, and at a lower cost. Specifically, machine learning models trained on a combination of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and field data can be used to estimate and monitor above-ground carbon using satellite data (Csillik et al. 2019). Further, initiatives such as NASA’s GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) program offer newly available input data, which will improve modeling even further.    We are partnering with academic and industry leaders to complete an independent, peer-reviewed study that will evaluate available remote sensing technologies and quantify their ability to accurately measure forest-based biomass and evaluate their appropriate use for forest inventory and monitoring requirements of carbon offset protocols. The results of that study are intended to inform the processes by which each of the major carbon registries will amend their methodologies to permit remote sensing in the forest inventory and/or monitoring phase of project development. This project is intended to be one of several sites at which we will pilot the use of remote sensing technology for the purposes of monitoring and reporting on our carbon sequestration activities.","TNC engages in FSC-certified, restoration-based forest management on the properties in this project, and we acknowledge that there are sometimes emissions related to that activity. With that said, we are engaged in a long-term science experiment in the 5,000-acre Ellsworth Creek watershed to better understand the carbon impact of this type of management. For the Ellsworth experiment, we divided the watershed into basins with different management regimes and have since conducted extensive monitoring to test and evaluate the impact of these different management regimes on forest structure, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. New results from that effort will be reported in 2021, and we will then adapt our management strategies to increase the multiple benefits generated by this project, including carbon sequestration.     In any case, the carbon footprint from this type of adaptive, restoration-based management is minimal as compared to the carbon footprint of industrial logging that would have otherwise resulted without our intervention. In this respect, despite the possibility of emissions from our management activities, the carbon impact of the project is net sequestering. We believe that the net benefit of these activities is properly reflected in the portion of our carbon credits relating to avoided emissions.",,,,,,,

Safeguarding this vast stretch of forest tackles climate change on two fronts: sequestering millions of tons of carbon dioxide and connecting a migratory corridor that scientists believe could be one of North America’s most important “escape routes” as plant and animal species shift their ranges to cooler climates. TNC research has identified the region as a globally significant biodiversity hotspot, a major North American migratory corridor, and home to a network of watersheds vital to both people and nature. The Cumberland Forest Project features expansive climate-resilient forests and more than 700 miles of headwater streams that feed into globally important rivers, including the Clinch, Cumberland, and larger Tennessee and Ohio River Systems.    The project was launched in 2019, with the acquisition of the Ataya and Highlands properties. Given the scale of the project, it was not possible to achieve with philanthropy alone. Rather, TNC created an impact investment fund, Cumberland Forest LP, to raise $130 million of debt and equity from investors to finance the acquisition. TNC is the sole member of Cumberland Forest GP, LLC, the Fund’s general partner, and is the Manager of Cumberland Forest LP controlling all aspects of property management with the goal of achieving conservation outcomes.

The participants in the Nature Trust are Coillte an Irish semi state company and Forestry partners with all the forestry services being provided by Coillte under a formal SLA. The funders of the project receive the Woodland Nature Credit which gives them the sole right to claim the carbon sequestered, biodiversity generates and amenity value all of which can be used as part of their environmental reporting obligations. The project is following the EU taxonomy for afforestation which includes periodic verification to ensure the benefits are accruing to the funders.

Trefadder AS,Yes,The right trees the right places to maximize CO2 capture,Premium Climate Forest,Forestry (removal only),,,Afforestation,"The project will deliver the tCDR- equivalents through planting of locally indigenous trees in Norway on areas which have recently undergone ”or are currently undergoing ”the transition to a forest dominated by deciduous broadleaved tree species (Betula spp.) of lower productivity. Through a careful selection that takes into account the 17 national criterias for planting climate forests,  such as cultural monuments, farmland, hiking areas, biological diversity, valuable cultural landscapes, protected areas, drinking water sources, areas to be demolished and areas that are not available for harvesting, we  collaborate with farmers and landowners to ensure employment and value creation in rural areas. All of our partners are PEFC certified or will use PEFC certified partners for the planting and forest care.

For areas which have already undergone the forest transition, spruce planting/pine projects fall under the improved forest management category  IFM � through a transition from low productivity to high productivity  LtHP. � These areas are limited to post-abandoned secondary forests ”or those regenerating largely through a natural process after abandonment of alternative land uses such as agriculture or pasture (FAO, 2003). For areas currently undergoing a process of transition but which do not yet meet the forest definition (FAO), we consider spruce planting projects as a form of accelerated forest conversion (AFC) that would rather fit inn to the IFM-category, then to a afforest/reforestation definition set by FAO. 
How we calculate and deliver CDR is explained in the Project Design Document. In brief, Trefadder deliveres CDR through planting high quality climate forests which sequesters CO2 from the atmosphere. The captured CO2 has a strong legal protection (the area is officially registered in Norwegian Land registry as climate forest). Microsoft`s payment for the CDR will go towards helping local landowners build premium climate forests with solid legal protection and to secure future forest nursery. The land used to build climate forest is still owned by the local landowner, while Trefadder is responsible for forest nursery plan, legal registration and certification. Trefadder owns the CDR which finances the afforestation.  
Trefadder AS was founded in 2019 in Haugesund, Norway. The founder, Anders Kristiansen is the main shareholder and CEO. Major participants are local landowners and farmers, which have areas suitable for climate forests, as well as our head of forest management, Rasmus Stokkeland-Hagalid.
","Project governance structure
Landowner reports to and is controlled by Trefadder`s project manager based on the contract created by lawyer firm BAHR. This contract states the terms for the climate forests for planting, maintenance, land use and so on. The project manager in turn reports to and is controlled by Trefadder`s management group based on CDR commitments made to partners. The management group reports to the board of directors.
Both landowners and Trefadder will be subject to controls by third party. 
All CDR-credits, sold and unsold by end of business year, is added to Trefadder`s annual audit.

Alongside Trefadder, KPMG Canada are developing a standard for climate forests in Norway. KPMG Canada has an extensive experience in creating national standards for climate forests. Furthermore Trefadder`s forest experts are working with Standard Norge and the lawyer firm BAHR to implement and ensure the quality and legal framework for climate forests in Norway. Inspection of the forests will be conducted by a third party which is certified and approved by KPMG Canada. 
An example of resource utlization; through forest management we remove trees that have not been given optimal growth conditions. These trees would normally be left in the forest to rot, but through the partnership with Beyonder, they may become raw materials in the batteries, providing both carbon capture storage as well as creating the world's first fully circular climate forest.(read more about the collaboration here: https://www.beyonder.no/news/which-trees-can-be-the-most-effective-natural-cathode-for-batteries )

Relevant management skills and experience
Trefadder`s management team has extensive experience in forestry and project development. 
Our management team has contributed to climate forest research on behalf of Klima- og miljodepartementet (Climate and environmental department in Norway). 
Working closely with Standard Norge to create a Norwegian standard for climate forests. The team has a varied background ranging from masters degree in forestry, degree in agriculture and aqua culture industry, masters degree in economics and M.Sc in maritime engineering.
","Trefadder was established as a company the 15th of September 2019. Our main shareholder, Dealmaker AS, where asked to show their climate accounting and offset their footprint by a partner in 2017. Dealmaker tried to find a local CDR-project but was unable to find any good CDR-projects in Norway. As part of the research, they found several afforestation/reforestation projects abroad and started to contemplate why this could not be done in Norway which is a politically stable country with solid regulations for land use and ownership. After reaching out to leading experts they were made aware of the 6.5 MUSD research project done on behalf of Klima og miljodepartmentet (climate and environmental department) regarding climate forests in Norway, and the important part it will play to reach the climate targets. The research project concluded that there is a great potential for climate forests in Norway. One of the leading experts was hired as project manager, and Trefadder had taken root. Soon after they contacted KPMG Canada which had written the Irish national standard on climate forests, which was the closest to Norwegian climate and conditions. When working on the Norwegian standard alongside KPMG Canada, the goal was always to make a Norwegian standard of the highest possible quality, so that Norwegian climate forests could be defined as premium climate forests. We are still in the process with Standard Norge to create a national Norwegian standard, which typically takes 4 years. To ensure legal rights for our future climate forests, we reached out to the leading lawyer firm BAHR. They loved the project and offered to help Trefadder pro-bono as well as doing their CDR with us.
Alongside and with the help of the Norwegian Minister of Finance, Trefadder was launched publicly.
A few weeks later the Minister of Agriculture presented Trefadder to farmers to show the possibilities to become  carbon farmers �.   
One of the first international companies to support us was actually Microsoft (Microsoft Azure Compute Grant) where we were given a grant to use AI to map biological and economical conditions in Norwegian forests.

Our calculations take into consideration negative aspects of the planting process mentioned in relevant literature. All planting is done by hand, and no machines are used in the planting process. ",Yes,Other (please specify),KPMG Canada,N/A,,,No,"Removal tons will be handed over to Microsoft after the measure has been verified by KPMG, both as a method and as an investment. While the status of the removal tonnage will be activated, it will be reported continuously after estimated binding. As an afforestation project, this will be net verified carbon equivalents on a permanent basis. In the foreseeable future, as a result of the agreement / investment made permanent on the property. 

Trefadder has drafted an agreement which will be entered into between Trefadder and various landowners throughout Norway. The purpose of the agreement is to increase the carbon uptake in Norwegian forests on a permanent basis, and the purpose will be met by planting trees on the landowner s property. In return, the landowner will receive remuneration based on the size of acres planted and the estimated carbon uptake (calculated by tonnes of Co2 x price). The agreement will regulate both the planting process, the management / maintenance of the planted forest and the eventual cutting down of the trees. Trefadder will supervise both the planting process and the maintenance of the forest, and the landowner will have to obtain Trefadder s consent when it is time to cut down the trees. 

Under Norwegian law, encumbrances / easements can be established over property in favor of any third parties where the encumbrance is expressly linked to the property in question. Although written and oral agreements pertaining to easements may be legally binding between the parties, the easement will have to be registered in the Land Register in order to obtain legal protection against third parties. By registering an easement in the Land Register, the easement obtains legal protection from the owner s creditors and prevents owners of the property from disposing of the property in violation of the easement. To ensure the rights and duties under the agreement between Trefadder and the landowner, a brief statement signed by both parties will be registered in the Land Register of the property in question. The statement cannot be deleted without Trefadder s consent, and will obligate whoever is the landowner at any given time to both plant and manage the forest in deliberation with Trefadder, and to obtain Trefadder s consent before logging. 
Thus, by registering the statement in the Land Registry, the planted forest will have a permanent legal protection. That will insure that, the given area will be forested on a permanent basis.
","Storm og Wind
Storm and wind damage is common in forests along the west coast of Norway and constitutes the greatest risk element for forestry. The extent of storm damage has increased for many decades already and the changes are expected to be further intensified (Hanssen et al., 2019s11). Ripple effects, as a result of increased precipitation and rot, will further increase the risk of damage to both individual trees and entire stands. Increased winds also reduce the quality of top shoots, while broken trees increase the risk of pests.  Spruce is most prone to storm damage and taller trees are more exposed to wind damage (Hanssen et al., 2019; Solberg et al., 2019). Full-grown trees are therefore also most exposed to such damage. Injuries also increase with decreasing diameter/height ratios and during tele-free (meaning when soil is frozen) winters (Solberg et al., 2019s.30). Planting on slopes also increases the risk of damage. Current risk-reducing measures are to mix other types of wood than spruce in the forest and distance regulation towards age class 3. Storm corridors are also an effective measure that ensures good space and little competition in the edges of the population. This gives the main stems large and stable root systems (Solberg et al., 2019). Other measures are to avoid thinning after 12 meters average height, as well as ditching to avoid hydrocephalus (Hanssen et al., 2019; Valinger et al., 2019). Analysis methods, based on historical data for the windfall, temperature data for modeling of highly exposed areas, and GIS analyzes, also reduce the risk in the project. Such modeling can also differentiate forest management locally. WINDA is an example of such an analysis. The WINDA model calculates the risk of wind damage for each stock (Solberg et al., 2008). In a scenario of upscaling of the climate forest it requires a GIS analysis-based risk assessment be carried out at the regional level (Vestli, 2016). This, together with the management measures mentioned above, will significantly reduce the risk.

Forestfire
We use historical data and estimated climate changes to assess the probability and risk of forest fires. Historically, areas in Western Norway have experienced natural forest fires per 100 km2 every 100-300 years (Hanssen et al., 2019s.20). Increased rain will lower the number of forest fires (Change, 2014). But the increase in maximum temperatures in seasons with a high risk of forest fires will increase the consequence when it occurs in the future (Hanssen et al., 2019s.21). One measure that effectively reduces the consequences of forest fires is to avoid pure coniferous forests. Trefadder has the desired degree of incorporation of roe, aspen, willow, and oak of 20% in the coniferous forest population, to ensure a greater cover of grass and moss, as a fire prevention measure. Pine is the most fire-exposed forest, while deciduous forest burns to a small degree (Hanssen et al., 2019; Sogaard et al., 2020). General preparedness at a national level is also a factor that should be incorporated in the risk assessment. The quality of emergency services and preparedness and coordination has increased the capability of combating forest fires. And it is constantly improving. A Scandinavian joint operational headquarters is also planned for the future.



Drought, water, and frost
Prolonged drought can lead to both direct and indirect damage to the forest. Increased drought can lead to reduced defense ability against pests and reduced growth conditions (Hanssen et al., 2019; Solberg et al., 2013). Based on estimated climate changes for Western Norway, it is expected that the frequency of droughts will decrease, while the consequences of possible drought, as a result of higher maximum temperatures, will increase the extent of the damage. Necessary silviculture actions, such as distance regulation towards age class 3, will be important to increase the drought tolerance of individuals (Hanssen et al., 2019; Kohler et al., 2010). In seasons with drouth, it will be challenging to plant a new forest. A postponement of planting season occasionally will have consequences for the climate forest storage for the affected projects and therefore represents a threat to the sequestration of greenhouse gases.
Frost damage occurs in Western Norway primarily in spring and autumn, most often when there are little snow and sudden cold spells. It is not common but occurs approx. once a decade. Frost can cause damage to foliage, buds, shoots, branches, cambium, and root systems  (Hanssen et al., 2019s.23). In the future, the forests will experience warmer winters, with several days with minimum temperatures above 0 Â° C. An increase in the extent of winter and spring frost damage is expected, as well as an increase in spruce damage to spruce in the coastal areas of south-eastern Norway (Solberg & Dalen, 2007s.6). New establishments are particularly vulnerable. This can be met with planting under shelterwood, which reduces the risk of drought, water, and frost.
",10000,10000,"Durability 
Trefadder has an eternity perspective in our climate investments through our targeted and selective selection of areas. Through an agreement with the landowner. The agreement is between the property and Trefadder and the agreement is registered as a realeasement on the property. This ensures that forests will be planted on the given area forever, after each rotation. If the landowner wishes to have the easement shipped or re-shipped on the given area, it must be replaced by an area that produces as much or more than the area that expires. This can only be done after felling. This means that all investments through Trefadder ensure an increased forest area on a permanent basis.

Risk of Physical Reversal
Risk strategy. Trefadder uses a safety margin/buffer pool of 40% and therefore distinguishes between bound CO2 and commercially available for sale. The excess volume from the investment portfolio is aggregated and can be reallocated if necessary should various calamities occur locally. This ensures that we can guarantee the invitation that is made. The safety margin is always recognized in the accounts at all times. Today, we also work with a tracking system based on blockchain technology to give each equivalent a unique tracking number, which will ensure full transparency with regard to everything we do. It will be connected with data from Katam and our GIS system, which will be available to all our customers.
","Through our systems, mentioned earlier, the buyer will have full access to see the development of their investments in relation to expected and actual growth, and risk margin available for relocation. 
","Through a management plan in the agreement between Trefadder and the landowner, the landowner undertakes to implement all management measures needed through the forest's rotation in order for it to be able to bind to a maximum of CO2. Together with climate risk analyzes based on weather data and future available research, the risk profile for the total portfolio will be significantly reduced.","Buffer pool consists of 40% of the bound CO2. The buffer pool is a mix from different stands, in different regions, along the western coastline in Norway. We define Trefadder as a national project for the time being, but which is rigged for expansion in the UK, Iceland, Sweden and Denmark amongst others.",The buffer pool is a mix from different Trefadder planting areas /climate forests in Norway.,"40% of all projects are added to the buffer pool. Trefadder plants 2 year old trees, to maximize survival and reduce risk.",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Our ideal outcome from this proposal is a 3 year contract which gives us a solid client and base to continue to build on. 
We do not have any minimum volumes for our partners, but help provide high quality CDR regardless of the volume. Our maximum volume for 2022 is 60.000 as offered, but we can offer higher CDR depending on the time of the response.
We have provided prices and volume for the next 3 years, but we are open to longer agreements if that is desired. ","As the exchange rate between USD/NOK varies, as an example it was below 6NOK per USD in 2014 and was over 10NOK per USD in 2020, we are hesitant to offer long binding offers. However, if the volume is of a certain size we can hedge this risk.","Trefadder will carry out field inspections after planting and every 5 years. Field inspections is a visual inspection. Every ten years, the field must be surveyed. In forest surveying several sampling methods are in use. We use a random, double sampling. That means relascope plots + field control. Measurement of volume is performed with systematic relascope assessment with control surfaces, also called double sampling. The method is based on laying out a systematic network of relascope surfaces. Here, the base area, average height, and volume are measured. Some areas are selected as control surfaces where the volume is estimated. The correction factor for the relascope rate is estimated from both measurements on the control surfaces (Fitje, 1991; Nersten, 1967). This is done manually today.

 

We are in a transition phase, form the old method and manual datacollection (with and without aerial photography), where we will switch to double sampling with of each individual tree together from new hardware (drones), and new software delivered by Katam inn Sweden. This provides a significantly high accuracy, while at the same time giving us a much more reasonable opportunity to register the CDR ex-post at a fraction of the cost, while at the same time providing full transparency to our customers to follow developments over time.

This will give us an error margin on less than 4 % on volume and it will give us a  live � update at a low cost, which we will connect with a complete in-house developed GIS system for managing risk margins and risk analysis.",1125,13,0,"Water stewardship: Our climate forests are only watered by natural rainfall, which is why we only plant in April-June and late August-October to avoid drought.

"Truterra, LLC",Yes,"Channeling trust, knowledge, and partnership to unlock durable soil organic carbon storage at scale","Project 1, Option A: Soil Carbon Pathways 2022, Prioritizing Scale & Durability",Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"Truterra is offering two alternatives for procurement of CDR FY 2022. Option 1A provides 400,000 MT CDR with vintage years 2017 through 2021. The project portfolio is blended to optimize for durability and scale. Approximately 80% of the project portfolio is comprised of low reversal risk tonnage, representing fields that established practice change within 4-5 years of enrollment. During this timeframe, a grower is experimenting and establishing a commitment to regenerative practices; a reasonable window within which to evaluate additionality. 

Because this portfolio is weighted in favor of more durable tonnage, the insurance buffer pool is targeted at 32% of project CDR. Our financial models estimate buffer pool needs as low as 20% for established practices to as high as 40%+ for first attempts at regenerative practices.

Similar to financial investment portfolios, risk portfolios of CDR investments vary greatly. Truterra s approach to a blended project portfolio provides buyer flexibility in using soil organic carbon from working lands agriculture to manage for cost, risk, and scale as the market and associated methodologies mature. 

Conceptually, each blended project portfolio consists of acreage from that falls into one of three pools. Projects scale in size as new acres are converted and enrolled. Concurrently, enrolled growers gain essential experience, maintaining an overall balanced portfolio.
  
 ¢  New Practice Change: This acreage transitioned to regenerative practices within one year of enrollment. This represents the most direct interpretation of additionality and therefore highest likelihood of future registry approval. This pool is at highest risk of reversal due to the challenges associated with practice transition. There is a high probability that acreage will revert to business-as-usual management. 
 ¢  1-3 Years Established Change: This acreage transitioned within 1-3 years of enrollment. This falls within a potentially acceptable interpretation of additionality by current market standards, resulting in a moderate likelihood of future registry approval and a moderately to high avoidable reversal risk. 
 ¢  4+ Years Established Change: This acreage has been converted more than three years prior to enrollment. This pool includes new CDR from acreage previously enrolled, as well as newly enrolled acreage that are 4-5 years established regenerative. This group represents the lowest risk of reversal but also the lowest likelihood of future registry approval.
 
Microsoft s payment will support grower onboarding and data collection, methodology development, modeling and in-field sampling, project development costs, third-party verification, monitoring, payment to growers, and project overhead.","The Land O Lakes network of member-owner ag retailers and local co-ops, which serve as farmers  trusted agronomy advisors, are critical to Truterra s delivery of new stewardship solutions, technology and innovation to the farm gate. Today, the Truterra network of retailers is comprised of 34 retail cooperatives with more than 700 locations in 15 states. New retailers are actively onboarding to the platform each month. These retailers are critical to both data collection efforts and delivery of insights, products and services to growers that lead to Carbon Dioxide Removals and emissions reductions. 

Truterra will subcontract with the Soil Health Institute (SHI) to provide leadership, review, and oversight of all aspects of soil science-related activities. SHI plays a critical role in evaluating the capacity of soil carbon measurement methodologies for a balance of scientific merit and scalability. Additionally, their contributions include in-field sampling techniques, stratification, sampling methodology design, uncertainty analysis, and training to Truterra s retail and agronomy network on soil sampling, soil health and economics. SHI s recently introduced North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements (NAPESHM) evaluates approximately 30 soil health indicators across North America, with the goal of identifying the most effective measurements of soil health across a wide range of properties. The work provides a protocol and roadmap for other soil scientists to build on this important data set. Furthermore, a collaboration with SHI provides the Truterra network of agricultural retailers and growers with access to soil health economics research that is a critical component to wide-scale adoption of regenerative agriculture practices.

A project developer will be subcontracted but has not been chosen at this time. Various potential partners are currently being considered to best advance scalable agricultural CDR project design to maximize impact and carbon removal efforts in the modern production agriculture environment. A third-party verifier will be used but has not yet been selected. Hiring experienced partners for each of these roles who can bring learnings from other sectors will be important to project success and the speed at which Truterra is able to aggregate and register a CDR project.

","The Truterra carbon program launched in Q1 2021 as a result of a successful bid in the initial round of the Microsoft Carbon Dioxide Removal RFP process. The carbon program was a natural extension for Truterra, which was formed five years earlier with the expressed mission of helping farmers preserve and protect their natural resources and scaling sustainable practice change in production agriculture. The Truterra team had long believed in the power of a vibrant carbon market to generate greater awareness of soil carbon, a key component of healthier, more productive, and more climate-resilient soil. 

The RFP provided the opportunity to turn that belief into action by providing a secured buyer for an initial round of carbon offset development. It set the Truterra team on the path to developing a best-in-class, voluntary carbon program that met the needs of farmers and carbon offset buyers alike. This industry-leading program combines a pragmatic understanding of commercial crop production with leading soil science and advanced carbon modeling and analytics. The result is a program that is both accessible by and acceptable to farmers, underpinned by science and technology.

The Soil Carbon Pathways projects build upon these learnings, creating the foundation for additional, long-term, systemic practice change and enhanced durability. By adopting and incorporating proven, portfolio-based risk-mitigation tactics, Soil Carbon Pathways creates the conditions required for sustained, meaningful change on the landscape, and a reliable long-term supply of carbon removal. The project s multi-pronged approach also opens up the carbon market opportunity to farms of all sizes and backgrounds, seeking to make transition support more accessible to historically underserved demographics. 

Project partners for 2022 and beyond will continue to include the cross-functional team that has contributed in critical ways to the successful launch of Truterra s carbon program in 2021. These include Soil Health Institute, Sierra View Consulting, Colorado State University Object Modeling Laboratory, and SureTech Laboratories, along with WinField United, a retailer and farmer network inherent to the Land O Lakes Cooperative network that allows Truterra to achieve meaningful scale.

","While any portion of the 2022 delivery is unlikely to be certified (due to timing and availability of suitable, scalable, and relevant Gold Standard Activity Modules), Truterra will develop CDR offsets based on an updated draft methodology that is an iteration of lessons learned through 2021 development and Microsoft s Criteria for High Quality Carbon Dioxide Removal. A modeled plus measured approach will be used for quantification and verification, and a third-party will be contracted to verify the project meets the agreed to methodology with material certainty.  

Looking to future years of delivery, Truterrra is committed to working towards developing and delivering registered CDR offset credits to Microsoft. Currently, Truterra is working through the recommended process of Gold Standard to seek approval of the needed Activity Modules to develop and register tonnage under their Soil Organic Carbon Framework. We have submitted a Concept Note. At this time, review of the Concept Note and next steps are pending until another organization moves forward in the process. This is because the Gold Standard Technical Advisory Committee will only review one proposal at a time, and the unnamed organization submitted their Concept Note ahead of the Truterra team.  

As efforts with Gold Standard continue to evolve, Truterra will communicate regularly with Microsoft on progress with Gold Standard, with the intention of jointly determining the highest value path and registration body for future credit certification. Overtime, we anticipate Gold Standard and other registries to organize and respond more aggressively to the growing and shifting demand for a soil organic carbon methodology that is both scalable and applies the rigor called for by sophisticated buyers. In the meantime, Truterra will continue to engage with a broad and diverse group of partners to advance our thinking and draft methodology, working towards a best-in-class protocol that addresses the unique strengths and challenges of removing carbon dioxide through regenerative, production agriculture at scale. 

Agricultural working lands hold massive opportunity as carbon sinks.  Realizing this opportunity presents many challenges; the long-term viability of a soil organic carbon market will require solutions that work for both the farmers who generate them and the buyers who seek them out. It is our core belief that this can only be achieved at the required scale by ongoing, iterative problem solving among a highly diverse, cross-functional group of motivated, engaged, and committed organizations with the common goal of realizing this significant opportunity.  Truterra has created and continues to expand this coalition of the committed, and we welcome continued engagement from the Microsoft team as we work with this community of collaborators to design, test, refine and deliver real solutions and real change.  Ultimately, we believe this is the best pathway to a registered methodology that delivers on the promise of soil organic carbon in agriculture. 
",Yes,," ¢	Insufficient farmer participation due to perception of carbon removal contracts as onerous or inflexible, and/or confusion/wait-and-see attitudes fostered by a plethora of market players.
 ¢	Avoidable reversals due to practice changes that fail to meet productivity and/or performance expectations.
 ¢	Insufficient carbon removal supply/market failure due to ill-conceived market standards that lack constructive, multi-stakeholder problem solving to address the limitations of a developing science.

",100,20,"100 years is specified as the durability of Truterra s CDR because it is a multi-generational timespan and considered to be effectively permanent. We believe a 20-year durability guarantee is appropriate and a strong indicator of effective permanence for the following reasons: 

1.	If field practices are monitored and verified for a 20-year period, the field has effectively been permanently converted to the regenerative practice. In fact, reverting to different practices after twenty years would undoubtedly require significantly different agronomic management experience and field equipment, particularly in our changing climate.

2.	A contractual requirement for an individual grower to report practice activity beyond 20-years is simply impractical. For the majority of U.S. farmers, a 20-year commitment spans the transition of farm management to the next generation, ensuring that regenerative practices are maintained through the transition to new management. Anything beyond this cannot be reasonably contemplated or contractually obligated, particularly of operating entities that are largely sole proprietorships.      

Truterra will pro-rate the risk of reversal over the 20-year reporting period for each field enrolled in a project, and maintains the project buffer pool accordingly. Fields that are early in their transition to regenerative practices are at the highest risk of reversal; fields that have been converted for three to five years carry a much lower risk of reversal.  The portfolio-based approach proposed by Truterra effectively balances this risk and provides Microsoft carbon dioxide removal at the project scale that is economical, durable, and additional. 
","Reversals will be monitored in two ways. First, farmers are contractually obligated to report event-based management each year of the durability-guarantee period. This reporting is done using Truterra Insights Engine technology with the support of Truterra s Data Collection Specialists, who work directly with farmers, while also being able to easily leverage data that has already been captured and recorded by the farmer s local ag retailer. Secondly, Truterra is investing in remote sensing technology to remotely monitor key events that signify compliance with maintenance of carbon dioxide removal practices such as change in land use, surface disturbance with tillage, and our continuous cropping cover. These methods combined will capture both avoidable and unavoidable reversals at a field level. Moreover, they allow farmers some flexibility to maintain CDR while still having some latitude in the in-field practices they implement from year to year. ","Truterra seeks to mitigate reversal risk via several means. In fact, risk mitigation is a key factor in our project development strategy. Project scale provides mitigation of unavoidable reversals by fields contributing to CDR being dispersed across U.S. cropland. By enrolling acres across the Truterra member-retailer network, we inherently reduce the risk of weather events having a catastrophic impact on the project as a whole. Also of note, the practices of no-tillage and cover cropping have been proven to lead to enhanced soil health, which improves a field s ability to remain productive and resilient in both drought conditions and intensive and frequent rain events, both of which are becoming more common due to climate change. 

Beyond this, projects are managed for avoidable risk in two key ways. First, our projects employ a portfolio-based approach to manage the risk of reversal by allowing specific portions of the project to be made up of fields and farmers who are at different points in the transition to regenerative practices. Fields must be converted at least one and up to five years prior to project enrollment. This mitigates the risk of a grower making a contractual commitment to these practices before he/she has fully transitioned and learned to farm in this new way. 

Soil carbon sequestration requires specific management practices tailored to the unique needs of each farm, which can vary based on geography, crop rotations, growing year and environmental conditions. Each year a farmer makes a decision to farm using regenerative practices, the outcome is additional, as is the commitment to maintain this storage long-term. The highest quality, most durable credits will come from farmers who have undergone a transitional period in which they will experiment to determine and refine the ideal practices for each field. As a farmer learns over growing seasons, he/she will continue to expand these practices across all acres under their management. Leveraging this first-hand, seeing-is-believing experience and growing commitment to regenerative practices, ensures the productive capacity of that field is maintained and that the regenerative practices are maintained and therefore durable. 

To amplify the impact of working with experienced regenerative farmers and convert as many new acres as possible to carbon storage, Truterra is partnering with Farmer s National Company, a professional land management firm. Farmer s National will identify non-operator landowners with an interest in selling carbon credits and help transition those acres to local farmers who have experience farming in no-till production systems. This mitigates the risk of transition to a regenerative system by working with landowners committed to climate-proofing their farms and farm operators who are already experienced in transitioning acres to no till and cover cropping systems.  According to the US Department of Agricultural Economic Research Service, more than 50% of U.S. farmland is rented. Strategies for working with absentee landowners are key to scaling regenerative agriculture and ensuring carbon storage is durable. 

Secondly, Truterra projects mitigate the risk of practice transition by ensuring that growers have access to both technical and financial assistance as part of their transition. As a business unit of Land O Lakes, Truterra was created to scale transition to more sustainable practices across production agriculture, completely independent of the carbon market. Deploying resources through our retail network - a farmer s trusted advisor - in order to support this transition and maintain productivity is the foundation of Truterra programming. Following are a sampling of the resources and programs deployed in cooperation with our retail network for the 2022 growing season: 

o	Truterra software assists a farmer and their trusted advisor in evaluating both the economic and environmental outcomes of practice change on different fields.
o	Complimentary soil health testing and planning will be provided in partnership with WinField United to qualifying growers within the WinField and Truterra-member network. This effort is a multi-million-dollar investment by the Land O Lakes enterprise to build a pipeline of growers ready to transition to more regenerative farming practices and ultimately transact carbon credits.
o	Soil health training and programming designed by Soil Health Institute will be provided to both WinField agronomists as well as local retail agronomists.
o	In-field trials in cooperation with local ag retailers, the Soil and Water Conservation Society, and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service demonstrate and evaluate at field scale improved nutrient management and cover cropping systems.
o	Dedicated Conservation Agronomists at 13 retailers provide direct to grower agronomic assistance, as well as train-the-trainer programming to local retail agronomists.
o	The Truterra Transformation Agronomy Network will be made available to all farmers who signed carbon services agreements in 2021 and in 2022. The purpose of the network is to provide specialized agronomy assistance and support of both network retail agronomists and farmers directly to troubleshoot any production issues as farmers transition to regenerative cropping systems. 
o	A pilot partnership with FarmRaise organization will provide specialized, one-on-one assistance to growers interested in financial assistance to support practice transition.
o	Targeted, on-site conservation agronomy assistance will be deployed through the Federation of Southern Cooperatives to bolster accessibility of both technical and financial assistance to black and historically underserved farmers in the region. 
","For Project 1, Option A, Truterra will target a buffer pool of 32% of delivered CDR tonnage. The buffer pool will be comprised of soil organic carbon CDR. This targeted buffer percentage is the result of blending the estimated avoidable risk for the portfolio presented in Project 1, Option A, which is optimized for maximum scale and durability.

The portfolio approach allows us to balance risk at a project level, so that fields earlier in the transition are balanced with fields and growers more seasoned in the transition and therefore lower risk. As projects are registered, additional credits will be committed to the registry as appropriate to protect against unavoidable reversals.

Additionally, Truterra is investigating other strategies to manage risk of reversal more aggressively without incorporating claw-back clauses for farmers in contracts, which we believe to be a perverse incentive to project participation. In addition to the buffer/insurance pool, other risk management alternatives under consideration include a farmer transition warranty program, as well as buffer pools consisting of riparian/set-aside acres in cropland agricultural fields.

Remote sensing will be used to verify practices as reported, but all data used to originate modeling is collected at a field level from the grower and the grower s trusted retail advisor. 

For this project, the DayCent model, version 4.5 (December 2016) will be used for the quantification of SOC at the field level, and N2O emissions from fertilizer and cover crop use at the project level. To confirm that SOC concentrations increase in the soil and support field-level model calibration, representative samples are required. Soil sampling data will be stratified based on three factors: 1) soil strata; 2) management strata; 3) climate strata.

Weather information for the specific year will be used to calculate the SOC increases in each year of the project. Direct quantification will be conducted at least once every 5 years during the project period. The baseline assessment is determined by collecting field-level data documenting the  pre-intervention � practices. This data is used along soil samples to validate the DayCent model and estimate the historic GHG fluxes associated with the project.

2.	SDG 15- Life on land- Reduction of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers
","A 2019 National Academy of Sciences report contends that restoration of agricultural soil carbon could simultaneously help resolve three global problems  “ food security, biodiversity, and climate change. When carbon is restored to agricultural soils by building soil organic matter, it makes the soils more fertile, better at retaining water and fertilizer, and more resilient to climate change. In addition to SDG-13- Climate action, measurable co-benefits include: 
1.	SDG 06- Clean water and sanitation- Decreased nutrient runoff and soil erosion from fields and reduced impact on related water bodies
2.	SDG 15- Life on land- Reduction of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers
","Truterra understands the importance of encouraging and enabling carbon market access for diverse, historically under-served farming populations. Addressing this need will be a growing focus of our work to engage and support growers in a transition to regenerative agriculture. We recently began engaging with the Federation of Southern Cooperatives to explore opportunities for improving technical assistance available to Black landowners and farm operators. In addition, we are collaborating with the American Farmland Trust, which has established an outreach program aimed at female land owners specifically.","As the carbon removal marketplace in agriculture evolves, with many new offers and players entering the marketplace, there is significant risk of this marketplace driving perverse outcomes due to a misalignment of resources and incentives with the challenges of regenerative agricultural practice adoption. 

One major risk to the evolution of this marketplace and to the scaling of regenerative agriculture as a climate solution is that some farmers may be encouraged to jump into new practices without the necessary agronomic and educational support to help ensure they are able to successfully integrate the new practices into their operation. Financial incentives alone are not enough and if a farmer attempts conversion and fails, this is not only a social harm to that farmer and farm community, but it is an environmental harm through the carbon storage reversal. Further, this is not a short-lived issue, as farmers that have this experience are highly unlikely to re-enter the market or retry the failed practices. Thus, that lost farmer or field is likely to be lost from the marketplace and the regenerative effort for multiple years, potentially through that entire generation of farm management. 

A second risk involves the current market definition of additionality, in which the market considers additionality as the initial attempt at a new practice rather than the integration and establishment of that practice as a successful transition to long-term adoption. With that narrow definition of additionality, there may be a perverse incentive for recent adopters of regenerative practices to reverse those practices to gain eligibility for the marketplace, thus releasing carbon that would have otherwise been stored. Additionally, this increases the avoidable reversal risk by forcing enrollment in the marketplace prior to farmers having reasonable certainty that they will maintain the new practices long-term. 

Through Truterra s program and partnership structure, we are mitigating both risks by building the agronomic and educational support network to improve success rates and durability among enrolled farmers. Going well beyond providing a technology and market engagement pathway to sell carbon, we are building the necessary infrastructure to scale regenerative agriculture by working with and expanding the support mechanisms and advisory channels farmers already know and trust to support improvements to their operational efficiency and productivity. Further, by engaging growers who have begun to demonstrate establishment of regenerative practices as well as those attempting these practices for the first time, we are building resilience and durability into credits generated while also building the peer-to-peer educational network to transfer knowledge and create momentum for scale.

"Truterra, LLC",No,"Channeling trust, knowledge, and partnership for quality soil organic carbon storage","Project 1, Option B: Soil Carbon Pathways 2022, Prioritizing Current Market Standards",Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"Truterra is offering two alternatives for procurement of CDR FY 2022. Option 1B provides 350,000 MT CDR with vintage years 2017 through 2021. The project portfolio is blended to provide a higher percentage of tonnage meeting current market standards. Approximately 32% of the project portfolio has established practice change within 3-years, providing a significant portion of tonnage registerable under current market standards. The resulting pricing is 11% per ton above Option 1A.

Because this portfolio is weighted in favor of acreage with less established transition, the insurance buffer pool is targeted at 35% of project CDR. Our financial models estimate buffer pool needs as low as 20% for established practices to as high as 40%+ for first attempts at regenerative practices.

Similar to financial investment portfolios, risk portfolios of CDR investments vary greatly. Truterra s approach to a blended project portfolio provides buyer flexibility in using soil organic carbon from working lands agriculture to manage for cost, risk, and scale as the market and associated methodologies mature. 

Conceptually, each blended project portfolio consists of acreage from that falls into one of three pools. Projects scale in size as new acres are converted and enrolled. Concurrently, enrolled growers gain essential experience, maintaining an overall balanced portfolio.  

 ¢  New Practice Change: This acreage transitioned to regenerative practices within one year of enrollment. This represents the most direct interpretation of additionality and therefore highest likelihood of future registry approval. This pool is at highest risk of reversal due to the challenges associated with practice transition. There is a high probability that acreage will revert to business-as-usual management. 
 ¢  1-3 Years Established Change: This acreage transitioned within 1-3 years of enrollment. This falls within a potentially acceptable interpretation of additionality by current market standards, resulting in a moderate likelihood of future registry approval and a moderately to high avoidable reversal risk. 
 ¢  4+ Years Established Change: This acreage has been converted more than three years prior to enrollment. This pool includes new CDR from acreage previously enrolled, as well as newly enrolled acreage that are 4-5 years established regenerative. This group represents the lowest risk of reversal but also the lowest likelihood of future registry approval.
 
Microsoft s payment will support grower onboarding and data collection, methodology development, modeling and in-field sampling, project development costs, third-party verification, monitoring, payment to growers, and project overhead.   
","The Land O Lakes network of member-owner ag retailers and local co-ops, which serve as farmers  trusted agronomy advisors, are critical to Truterra s delivery of new stewardship solutions, technology and innovation to the farm gate. Today, the Truterra network of retailers is comprised of 34 retail cooperatives with more than 700 locations in 15 states. New retailers are actively onboarding to the platform each month. These retailers are critical to both data collection efforts and delivery of insights, products and services to growers that lead to Carbon Dioxide Removals and emissions reductions. 

Truterra will subcontract with the Soil Health Institute (SHI) to provide leadership, review, and oversight of all aspects of soil science-related activities. SHI plays a critical role in evaluating the capacity of soil carbon measurement methodologies for a balance of scientific merit and scalability. Additionally, their contributions include in-field sampling techniques, stratification, sampling methodology design, uncertainty analysis, and training to Truterra s retail and agronomy network on soil sampling, soil health and economics. SHI s recently introduced North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements (NAPESHM) evaluates approximately 30 soil health indicators across North America, with the goal of identifying the most effective measurements of soil health across a wide range of properties. The work provides a protocol and roadmap for other soil scientists to build on this important data set. Furthermore, a collaboration with SHI provides the Truterra network of agricultural retailers and growers with access to soil health economics research that is a critical component to wide-scale adoption of regenerative agriculture practices.

A project developer will be subcontracted but has not been chosen at this time. Various potential partners are currently being considered to best advance scalable agricultural CDR project design to maximize impact and carbon removal efforts in the modern production agriculture environment. A third-party verifier will be used but has not yet been selected. Hiring experienced partners for each of these roles who can bring learnings from other sectors will be important to project success and the speed at which Truterra is able to aggregate and register a CDR project.

","The Truterra carbon program launched in Q1 2021 as a result of a successful bid in the initial round of the Microsoft Carbon Dioxide Removal RFP process. The carbon program was a natural extension for Truterra, which was formed five years earlier with the expressed mission of helping farmers preserve and protect their natural resources and scaling sustainable practice change in production agriculture. The Truterra team had long believed in the power of a vibrant carbon market to generate greater awareness of soil carbon, a key component of healthier, more productive, and more climate-resilient soil. 

The RFP provided the opportunity to turn that belief into action by providing a secured buyer for an initial round of carbon offset development. It set the Truterra team on the path to developing a best-in-class, voluntary carbon program that met the needs of farmers and carbon offset buyers alike. This industry-leading program combines a pragmatic understanding of commercial crop production with leading soil science and advanced carbon modeling and analytics. The result is a program that is both accessible by and acceptable to farmers, underpinned by science and technology.

The Soil Carbon Pathways projects build upon these learnings, creating the foundation for additional, long-term, systemic practice change and enhanced durability. By adopting and incorporating proven, portfolio-based risk-mitigation tactics, Soil Carbon Pathways creates the conditions required for sustained, meaningful change on the landscape, and a reliable long-term supply of carbon removal. The project s multi-pronged approach also opens up the carbon market opportunity to farms of all sizes and backgrounds, seeking to make transition support more accessible to historically underserved demographics. 

Project partners for 2022 and beyond will continue to include the cross-functional team that has contributed in critical ways to the successful launch of Truterra s carbon program in 2021. These include Soil Health Institute, Sierra View Consulting, Colorado State University Object Modeling Laboratory, and SureTech Laboratories, along with WinField United, a retailer and farmer network inherent to the Land O Lakes Cooperative network that allows Truterra to achieve meaningful scale.

","While any portion of the 2022 delivery is unlikely to be certified (due to timing and availability of suitable, scalable, and relevant Gold Standard Activity Modules), Truterra will develop CDR offsets based on an updated draft methodology that is an iteration of lessons learned through 2021 development and Microsoft s Criteria for High Quality Carbon Dioxide Removal. A modeled plus measured approach will be used for quantification and verification, and a third-party will be contracted to verify the project meets the agreed to methodology with material certainty.  

Looking to future years of delivery, Truterrra is committed to working towards developing and delivering registered CDR offset credits to Microsoft. Currently, Truterra is working through the recommended process of Gold Standard to seek approval of the needed Activity Modules to develop and register tonnage under their Soil Organic Carbon Framework. We have submitted a Concept Note. At this time, review of the Concept Note and next steps are pending until another organization moves forward in the process. This is because the Gold Standard Technical Advisory Committee will only review one proposal at a time, and the unnamed organization submitted their Concept Note ahead of the Truterra team.  

As efforts with Gold Standard continue to evolve, Truterra will communicate regularly with Microsoft on progress with Gold Standard, with the intention of jointly determining the highest value path and registration body for future credit certification. Overtime, we anticipate Gold Standard and other registries to organize and respond more aggressively to the growing and shifting demand for a soil organic carbon methodology that is both scalable and applies the rigor called for by sophisticated buyers. In the meantime, Truterra will continue to engage with a broad and diverse group of partners to advance our thinking and draft methodology, working towards a best-in-class protocol that addresses the unique strengths and challenges of removing carbon dioxide through regenerative, production agriculture at scale. 

Agricultural working lands hold massive opportunity as carbon sinks.  Realizing this opportunity presents many challenges; the long-term viability of a soil organic carbon market will require solutions that work for both the farmers who generate them and the buyers who seek them out. It is our core belief that this can only be achieved at the required scale by ongoing, iterative problem solving among a highly diverse, cross-functional group of motivated, engaged, and committed organizations with the common goal of realizing this significant opportunity.  Truterra has created and continues to expand this coalition of the committed, and we welcome continued engagement from the Microsoft team as we work with this community of collaborators to design, test, refine and deliver real solutions and real change.  Ultimately, we believe this is the best pathway to a registered methodology that delivers on the promise of soil organic carbon in agriculture. 
",Yes,," ¢	Insufficient farmer participation due to perception of carbon removal contracts as onerous or inflexible, and/or confusion/wait-and-see attitudes fostered by a plethora of market players.

",100,20,"100 years is specified as the durability of Truterra s CDR because it is a multi-generational timespan and considered to be effectively permanent. We believe a 20-year durability guarantee is appropriate and a strong indicator of effective permanence for the following reasons: 

1.	If field practices are monitored and verified for a 20-year period, the field has effectively been permanently converted to the regenerative practice. In fact, reverting to different practices after twenty years would undoubtedly require significantly different agronomic management experience and field equipment, particularly in our changing climate.
2.	A contractual requirement for an individual grower to report practice activity beyond 20-years is simply impractical. For the majority of U.S. farmers, a 20-year commitment spans the transition of farm management to the next generation, ensuring that regenerative practices are maintained through the transition to new management. Anything beyond this cannot be reasonably contemplated or contractually obligated, particularly of operating entities that are largely sole proprietorships.      

Truterra will pro-rate the risk of reversal over the 20-year reporting period for each field enrolled in a project, and maintains the project buffer pool accordingly. Fields that are early in their transition to regenerative practices are at the highest risk of reversal; fields that have been converted for three to five years carry a much lower risk of reversal.  The portfolio-based approach proposed by Truterra effectively balances this risk and provides Microsoft carbon dioxide removal at the project scale that is economical, durable, and additional. 
","Reversals will be monitored in two ways. First, farmers are contractually obligated to report event-based management each year of the durability-guarantee period. This reporting is done using Truterra Insights Engine technology with the support of Truterra s Data Collection Specialists, who work directly with farmers, while also being able to easily leverage data that has already been captured and recorded by the farmer s local ag retailer. Secondly, Truterra is investing in remote sensing technology to remotely monitor key events that signify compliance with maintenance of carbon dioxide removal practices such as change in land use, surface disturbance with tillage, and our continuous cropping cover. These methods combined will capture both avoidable and unavoidable reversals at a field level. Moreover, they allow farmers some flexibility to maintain CDR while still having some latitude in the in-field practices they implement from year to year. ","Truterra seeks to mitigate reversal risk via several means. In fact, risk mitigation is a key factor in our project development strategy. Project scale provides mitigation of unavoidable reversals by fields contributing to CDR being dispersed across U.S. cropland. By enrolling acres across the Truterra member-retailer network, we inherently reduce the risk of weather events having a catastrophic impact on the project as a whole. Also of note, the practices of no-tillage and cover cropping have been proven to lead to enhanced soil health, which improves a field s ability to remain productive and resilient in both drought conditions and intensive and frequent rain events, both of which are becoming more common due to climate change. 

Beyond this, projects are managed for avoidable risk in two key ways. First, our projects employ a portfolio-based approach to manage the risk of reversal by allowing specific portions of the project to be made up of fields and farmers who are at different points in the transition to regenerative practices. Fields must be converted at least one and up to five years prior to project enrollment. This mitigates the risk of a grower making a contractual commitment to these practices before he/she has fully transitioned and learned to farm in this new way. 

Soil carbon sequestration requires specific management practices tailored to the unique needs of each farm, which can vary based on geography, crop rotations, growing year and environmental conditions. Each year a farmer makes a decision to farm using regenerative practices, the outcome is additional, as is the commitment to maintain this storage long-term. The highest quality, most durable credits will come from farmers who have undergone a transitional period in which they will experiment to determine and refine the ideal practices for each field. As a farmer learns over growing seasons, he/she will continue to expand these practices across all acres under their management. Leveraging this first-hand, seeing-is-believing experience and growing commitment to regenerative practices, ensures the productive capacity of that field is maintained and that the regenerative practices are maintained and therefore durable. 

To amplify the impact of working with experienced regenerative farmers and convert as many new acres as possible to carbon storage, Truterra is partnering with Farmer s National Company, a professional land management firm. Farmer s National will identify non-operator landowners with an interest in selling carbon credits and help transition those acres to local farmers who have experience farming in no-till production systems. This mitigates the risk of transition to a regenerative system by working with landowners committed to climate-proofing their farms and farm operators who are already experienced in transitioning acres to no till and cover cropping systems.  According to the US Department of Agricultural Economic Research Service, more than 50% of U.S. farmland is rented. Strategies for working with absentee landowners are key to scaling regenerative agriculture and ensuring carbon storage is durable. 

Secondly, Truterra projects mitigate the risk of practice transition by ensuring that growers have access to both technical and financial assistance as part of their transition. As a business unit of Land O Lakes, Truterra was created to scale transition to more sustainable practices across production agriculture, completely independent of the carbon market. Deploying resources through our retail network - a farmer s trusted advisor - in order to support this transition and maintain productivity is the foundation of Truterra programming. Following are a sampling of the resources and programs deployed in cooperation with our retail network for the 2022 growing season: 
o	Truterra software assists a farmer and their trusted advisor in evaluating both the economic and environmental outcomes of practice change on different fields.
o	Complimentary soil health testing and planning will be provided in partnership with WinField United to qualifying growers within the WinField and Truterra-member network. This effort is a multi-million-dollar investment by the Land O Lakes enterprise to build a pipeline of growers ready to transition to more regenerative farming practices and ultimately transact carbon credits.
o	Soil health training and programming designed by Soil Health Institute will be provided to both WinField agronomists as well as local retail agronomists.
o	In-field trials in cooperation with local ag retailers, the Soil and Water Conservation Society, and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service demonstrate and evaluate at field scale improved nutrient management and cover cropping systems.
o	Dedicated Conservation Agronomists at 13 retailers provide direct to grower agronomic assistance, as well as train-the-trainer programming to local retail agronomists.
o	The Truterra Transformation Agronomy Network will be made available to all farmers who signed carbon services agreements in 2021 and in 2022. The purpose of the network is to provide specialized agronomy assistance and support of both network retail agronomists and farmers directly to troubleshoot any production issues as farmers transition to regenerative cropping systems. 
o	A pilot partnership with FarmRaise organization will provide specialized, one-on-one assistance to growers interested in financial assistance to support practice transition.
o	Targeted, on-site conservation agronomy assistance will be deployed through the Federation of Southern Cooperatives to bolster accessibility of both technical and financial assistance to black and historically underserved farmers in the region.  
","For Project 1, Option B, Truterra will target a buffer pool of 35% of delivered CDR tonnage. The buffer pool will be comprised of soil organic carbon CDR. This targeted buffer percentage is the result of blending the estimated avoidable risk for the portfolio presented in Project 1, Option B, which is optimized to meet the current market standard for additionality.

The portfolio approach allows us to balance risk at a project level, so that fields earlier in the transition are balanced with fields and growers more seasoned in the transition and therefore lower risk. As projects are registered, additional credits will be committed to the registry as appropriate to protect against unavoidable reversals.

Additionally, Truterra is investigating other strategies to manage risk of reversal more aggressively without incorporating claw-back clauses for farmers in contracts, which we believe to be a perverse incentive to project participation. In addition to the buffer/insurance pool, other risk management alternatives under consideration include a farmer transition warranty program, as well as buffer pools consisting of riparian/set-aside acres in cropland agricultural fields.
",The buffer pool will be comprised of soil organic carbon CDR from this project.,Truterra will target a buffer pool of 35% of delivered CDR tonnage,"FY22 sale only (July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022)",,,"This project will use two approaches for the quantification and verification of GHG fluxes: biogeochemical modeling and in-field sampling. Remote sensing will be used to verify practices as reported, but all data used to originate modeling is collected at a field level from the grower and the grower s trusted retail advisor. 

For this project, the DayCent model, version 4.5 (December 2016) will be used for the quantification of SOC at the field level, and N2O emissions from fertilizer and cover crop use at the project level. To confirm that SOC concentrations increase in the soil and support field-level model calibration, representative samples are required. Soil sampling data will be stratified based on three factors: 1) soil strata; 2) management strata; 3) climate strata.

Weather information for the specific year will be used to calculate the SOC increases in each year of the project. Direct quantification will be conducted at least once every 5 years during the project period. The baseline assessment is determined by collecting field-level data documenting the  pre-intervention � practices. This data is used along soil samples to validate the DayCent model and estimate the historic GHG fluxes associated with the project. 
",242914,0.741,n/a,"Water stewardship, ecosystem protection, climate resilience","A 2019 National Academy of Sciences report contends that restoration of agricultural soil carbon could simultaneously help resolve three global problems  “ food security, biodiversity, and climate change. When carbon is restored to agricultural soils by building soil organic matter, it makes the soils more fertile, better at retaining water and fertilizer, and more resilient to climate change. In addition to SDG-13- Climate action, measurable co-benefits include: 
1.	SDG 06- Clean water and sanitation- Decreased nutrient runoff and soil erosion from fields and reduced impact on related water bodies
2.	SDG 15- Life on land- Reduction of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers","Truterra understands the importance of encouraging and enabling carbon market access for diverse, historically under-served farming populations. Addressing this need will be a growing focus of our work to engage and support growers in a transition to regenerative agriculture. We recently began engaging with the Federation of Southern Cooperatives to explore opportunities for improving technical assistance available to Black landowners and farm operators. In addition, we are collaborating with the American Farmland Trust, which has established an outreach program aimed at female land owners specifically.","As the carbon removal marketplace in agriculture evolves, with many new offers and players entering the marketplace, there is significant risk of this marketplace driving perverse outcomes due to a misalignment of resources and incentives with the challenges of regenerative agricultural practice adoption. 

One major risk to the evolution of this marketplace and to the scaling of regenerative agriculture as a climate solution is that some farmers may be encouraged to jump into new practices without the necessary agronomic and educational support to help ensure they are able to successfully integrate the new practices into their operation. Financial incentives alone are not enough and if a farmer attempts conversion and fails, this is not only a social harm to that farmer and farm community, but it is an environmental harm through the carbon storage reversal. Further, this is not a short-lived issue, as farmers that have this experience are highly unlikely to re-enter the market or retry the failed practices. Thus, that lost farmer or field is likely to be lost from the marketplace and the regenerative effort for multiple years, potentially through that entire generation of farm management. 

A second risk involves the current market definition of additionality, in which the market considers additionality as the initial attempt at a new practice rather than the integration and establishment of that practice as a successful transition to long-term adoption. With that narrow definition of additionality, there may be a perverse incentive for recent adopters of regenerative practices to reverse those practices to gain eligibility for the marketplace, thus releasing carbon that would have otherwise been stored. Additionally, this increases the avoidable reversal risk by forcing enrollment in the marketplace prior to farmers having reasonable certainty that they will maintain the new practices long-term. 

Through Truterra s program and partnership structure, we are mitigating both risks by building the agronomic and educational support network to improve success rates and durability among enrolled farmers. Going well beyond providing a technology and market engagement pathway to sell carbon, we are building the necessary infrastructure to scale regenerative agriculture by working with and expanding the support mechanisms and advisory channels farmers already know and trust to support improvements to their operational efficiency and productivity. Further, by engaging growers who have begun to demonstrate establishment of regenerative practices as well as those attempting these practices for the first time, we are building resilience and durability into credits generated while also building the peer-to-peer educational network to transfer knowledge and create momentum for scale.

"Truterra, LLC",No,"Channeling trust, knowledge, and partnership towards unlocking supply at scale",Project 2: Unlocking Future Soil Organic Carbon CDR Supply,Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage (removal only),,,,"Engaging and supporting growers through a successful transition to regenerative agriculture is key to unlocking soil organic carbon CDR supply. The decision to change farming practices takes multi-year consideration, extensive planning, and a support infrastructure that today is in its infancy. To deliver scale, Truterra must urgently and aggressively invest in building a pipeline of practice change and a committed base of growers and trusted advisors. 

Project 2 provides Microsoft preferential access to best-in-class CDR through a multi-year offtake agreement, forecasted here through FY2027 but extendable through 2030 and beyond.  The offering is structured to allow Microsoft maximum flexibility to manage for cost, risk, and scale as the market and associated methodologies mature, yet provide Truterra the security to continue to build our pipeline of practice change. 

Annually, Truterra and Microsoft will collaborate to rebalance the CDR portfolio targets for the upcoming 24-months, based on Microsoft s own portfolio needs, grower/supply market indicators, lessons learned, and registration status. Adjustments will be made to allocation of risk pools and costs of goods sold, specifically the payment offered to the grower and the buffer/insurance pool. 

Conceptually, each blended project portfolio consists of acreage that falls into one of three pools. Projects scale in size as new acres are converted and enrolled. Concurrently, enrolled growers gain essential experience, maintaining an overall balanced portfolio.
  
 ¢  New Practice Change: This acreage transitioned to regenerative practices within one year of enrollment. This represents the most direct interpretation of additionality and therefore highest likelihood of future registry approval. This pool is at highest risk of reversal due to the challenges associated with practice transition. There is a high probability that acreage will revert to business-as-usual management. 
 ¢  1-3 Years Established Change: This acreage transitioned within 1-3 years of enrollment. This falls within a potentially acceptable interpretation of additionality by current market standards, resulting in a moderate likelihood of future registry approval and a moderately to high avoidable reversal risk. 
 ¢  4+ Years Established Change: This acreage has been converted more than three years prior to enrollment. This pool includes new CDR from acreage previously enrolled, as well as newly enrolled acres that are 4-5 years established regenerative. This group represents the lowest risk of reversal but also the lowest likelihood of future registry approval.
 
Microsoft s payment will support grower onboarding and data collection, methodology development, modeling and in-field sampling, project development costs, third-party verification, monitoring, payment to growers, and project overhead.   
","The Land O Lakes network of member-owner ag retailers and local co-ops, which serve as farmers  trusted agronomy advisors, are critical to Truterra s delivery of new stewardship solutions, technology and innovation to the farm gate. Today, the Truterra network of retailers is comprised of 34 retail cooperatives with more than 700 locations in 15 states. New retailers are actively onboarding to the platform each month. These retailers are critical to both data collection efforts and delivery of insights, products and services to growers that lead to Carbon Dioxide Removals and emissions reductions. 

Truterra will subcontract with the Soil Health Institute (SHI) to provide leadership, review, and oversight of all aspects of soil science-related activities. SHI plays a critical role in evaluating the capacity of soil carbon measurement methodologies for a balance of scientific merit and scalability. Additionally, their contributions include in-field sampling techniques, stratification, sampling methodology design, uncertainty analysis, and training to Truterra s retail and agronomy network on soil sampling, soil health and economics. SHI s recently introduced North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements (NAPESHM) evaluates approximately 30 soil health indicators across North America, with the goal of identifying the most effective measurements of soil health across a wide range of properties. The work provides a protocol and roadmap for other soil scientists to build on this important data set. Furthermore, a collaboration with SHI provides the Truterra network of agricultural retailers and growers with access to soil health economics research that is a critical component to wide-scale adoption of regenerative agriculture practices.

A project developer will be subcontracted but has not been chosen at this time. Various potential partners are currently being considered to best advance scalable agricultural CDR project design to maximize impact and carbon removal efforts in the modern production agriculture environment. A third-party verifier will be used but has not yet been selected. Hiring experienced partners for each of these roles who can bring learnings from other sectors will be important to project success and the speed at which Truterra is able to aggregate and register a CDR project.

","The Truterra carbon program launched in Q1 2021 as a result of a successful bid in the initial round of the Microsoft Carbon Dioxide Removal RFP process. The carbon program was a natural extension for Truterra, which was formed five years earlier with the expressed mission of helping farmers preserve and protect their natural resources and scaling sustainable practice change in production agriculture. The Truterra team had long believed in the power of a vibrant carbon market to generate greater awareness of soil carbon, a key component of healthier, more productive, and more climate-resilient soil. 

The RFP provided the opportunity to turn that belief into action by providing a secured buyer for an initial round of carbon offset development. It set the Truterra team on the path to developing a best-in-class, voluntary carbon program that met the needs of farmers and carbon offset buyers alike. This industry-leading program combines a pragmatic understanding of commercial crop production with leading soil science and advanced carbon modeling and analytics. The result is a program that is both accessible by and acceptable to farmers, underpinned by science and technology.

The Soil Carbon Pathways projects build upon these learnings, creating the foundation for additional, long-term, systemic practice change and enhanced durability. By adopting and incorporating proven, portfolio-based risk-mitigation tactics, Soil Carbon Pathways creates the conditions required for sustained, meaningful change on the landscape, and a reliable long-term supply of carbon removal. The project s multi-pronged approach also opens up the carbon market opportunity to farms of all sizes and backgrounds, seeking to make transition support more accessible to historically underserved demographics. 

Project partners for 2022 and beyond will continue to include the cross-functional team that has contributed in critical ways to the successful launch of Truterra s carbon program in 2021. These include Soil Health Institute, Sierra View Consulting, Colorado State University Object Modeling Laboratory, and SureTech Laboratories, along with WinField United, a retailer and farmer network inherent to the Land O Lakes Cooperative network that allows Truterra to achieve meaningful scale.

","While any portion of the 2022 delivery is unlikely to be certified (due to timing and availability of suitable, scalable, and relevant Gold Standard Activity Modules), Truterra will develop CDR offsets based on an updated draft methodology that is an iteration of lessons learned through 2021 development and Microsoft s Criteria for High Quality Carbon Dioxide Removal. A modeled plus measured approach will be used for quantification and verification, and a third-party will be contracted to verify the project meets the agreed to methodology with material certainty.  

Looking to future years of delivery, Truterrra is committed to working towards developing and delivering registered CDR offset credits to Microsoft. Currently, Truterra is working through the recommended process of Gold Standard to seek approval of the needed Activity Modules to develop and register tonnage under their Soil Organic Carbon Framework. We have submitted a Concept Note. At this time, review of the Concept Note and next steps are pending until another organization moves forward in the process. This is because the Gold Standard Technical Advisory Committee will only review one proposal at a time, and the unnamed organization submitted their Concept Note ahead of the Truterra team.  

As efforts with Gold Standard continue to evolve, Truterra will communicate regularly with Microsoft on progress with Gold Standard, with the intention of jointly determining the highest value path and registration body for future credit certification. Overtime, we anticipate Gold Standard and other registries to organize and respond more aggressively to the growing and shifting demand for a soil organic carbon methodology that is both scalable and applies the rigor called for by sophisticated buyers. In the meantime, Truterra will continue to engage with a broad and diverse group of partners to advance our thinking and draft methodology, working towards a best-in-class protocol that addresses the unique strengths and challenges of removing carbon dioxide through regenerative, production agriculture at scale. 

Agricultural working lands hold massive opportunity as carbon sinks.  Realizing this opportunity presents many challenges; the long-term viability of a soil organic carbon market will require solutions that work for both the farmers who generate them and the buyers who seek them out. It is our core belief that this can only be achieved at the required scale by ongoing, iterative problem solving among a highly diverse, cross-functional group of motivated, engaged, and committed organizations with the common goal of realizing this significant opportunity.  Truterra has created and continues to expand this coalition of the committed, and we welcome continued engagement from the Microsoft team as we work with this community of collaborators to design, test, refine and deliver real solutions and real change.  Ultimately, we believe this is the best pathway to a registered methodology that delivers on the promise of soil organic carbon in agriculture.

",100,20,"100 years is specified as the durability of Truterra s CDR because it is a multi-generational timespan and considered to be effectively permanent. We believe a 20-year durability guarantee is appropriate and a strong indicator of effective permanence for the following reasons: 

1.	If field practices are monitored and verified for a 20-year period, the field has effectively been permanently converted to the regenerative practice. In fact, reverting to different practices after twenty years would undoubtedly require significantly different agronomic management experience and field equipment, particularly in our changing climate.
2.	A contractual requirement for an individual grower to report practice activity beyond 20-years is simply impractical. For the majority of U.S. farmers, a 20-year commitment spans the transition of farm management to the next generation, ensuring that regenerative practices are maintained through the transition to new management. Anything beyond this cannot be reasonably contemplated or contractually obligated, particularly of operating entities that are largely sole proprietorships.      

Truterra will pro-rate the risk of reversal over the 20-year reporting period for each field enrolled in a project, and maintains the project buffer pool accordingly. Fields that are early in their transition to regenerative practices are at the highest risk of reversal; fields that have been converted for three to five years carry a much lower risk of reversal.  The portfolio-based approach proposed by Truterra effectively balances this risk and provides Microsoft carbon dioxide removal at the project scale that is economical, durable, and additional. 
","Reversals will be monitored in two ways. First, farmers are contractually obligated to report event-based management each year of the durability-guarantee period. This reporting is done using Truterra Insights Engine technology with the support of Truterra s Data Collection Specialists, who work directly with farmers, while also being able to easily leverage data that has already been captured and recorded by the farmer s local ag retailer. Secondly, Truterra is investing in remote sensing technology to remotely monitor key events that signify compliance with maintenance of carbon dioxide removal practices such as change in land use, surface disturbance with tillage, and our continuous cropping cover. These methods combined will capture both avoidable and unavoidable reversals at a field level. Moreover, they allow farmers some flexibility to maintain CDR while still having some latitude in the in-field practices they implement from year to year. ","Truterra seeks to mitigate reversal risk via several means. In fact, risk mitigation is a key factor in our project development strategy. Project scale provides mitigation of unavoidable reversals by fields contributing to CDR being dispersed across U.S. cropland. By enrolling acres across the Truterra member-retailer network, we inherently reduce the risk of weather events having a catastrophic impact on the project as a whole. Also of note, the practices of no-tillage and cover cropping have been proven to lead to enhanced soil health, which improves a field s ability to remain productive and resilient in both drought conditions and intensive and frequent rain events, both of which are becoming more common due to climate change. 

Beyond this, projects are managed for avoidable risk in two key ways. First, our projects employ a portfolio-based approach to manage the risk of reversal by allowing specific portions of the project to be made up of fields and farmers who are at different points in the transition to regenerative practices. Fields must be converted at least one and up to five years prior to project enrollment. This mitigates the risk of a grower making a contractual commitment to these practices before he/she has fully transitioned and learned to farm in this new way. 

Soil carbon sequestration requires specific management practices tailored to the unique needs of each farm, which can vary based on geography, crop rotations, growing year and environmental conditions. Each year a farmer makes a decision to farm using regenerative practices, the outcome is additional, as is the commitment to maintain this storage long-term. The highest quality, most durable credits will come from farmers who have undergone a transitional period in which they will experiment to determine and refine the ideal practices for each field. As a farmer learns over growing seasons, he/she will continue to expand these practices across all acres under their management. Leveraging this first-hand, seeing-is-believing experience and growing commitment to regenerative practices, ensures the productive capacity of that field is maintained and that the regenerative practices are maintained and therefore durable. 

To amplify the impact of working with experienced regenerative farmers and convert as many new acres as possible to carbon storage, Truterra is partnering with Farmer s National Company, a professional land management firm. Farmer s National will identify non-operator landowners with an interest in selling carbon credits and help transition those acres to local farmers who have experience farming in no-till production systems. This mitigates the risk of transition to a regenerative system by working with landowners committed to climate-proofing their farms and farm operators who are already experienced in transitioning acres to no till and cover cropping systems.  According to the US Department of Agricultural Economic Research Service, more than 50% of U.S. farmland is rented. Strategies for working with absentee landowners are key to scaling regenerative agriculture and ensuring carbon storage is durable. 

Secondly, Truterra projects mitigate the risk of practice transition by ensuring that growers have access to both technical and financial assistance as part of their transition. As a business unit of Land O Lakes, Truterra was created to scale transition to more sustainable practices across production agriculture, completely independent of the carbon market. Deploying resources through our retail network - a farmer s trusted advisor - in order to support this transition and maintain productivity is the foundation of Truterra programming. Following are a sampling of the resources and programs deployed in cooperation with our retail network for the 2022 growing season: 

o	Truterra software assists a farmer and their trusted advisor in evaluating both the economic and environmental outcomes of practice change on different fields.
o	Complimentary soil health testing and planning will be provided in partnership with WinField United to qualifying growers within the WinField and Truterra-member network. This effort is a multi-million-dollar investment by the Land O Lakes enterprise to build a pipeline of growers ready to transition to more regenerative farming practices and ultimately transact carbon credits.
o	Soil health training and programming designed by Soil Health Institute will be provided to both WinField agronomists as well as local retail agronomists.
o	In-field trials in cooperation with local ag retailers, the Soil and Water Conservation Society, and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service demonstrate and evaluate at field scale improved nutrient management and cover cropping systems.
o	Dedicated Conservation Agronomists at 13 retailers provide direct to grower agronomic assistance, as well as train-the-trainer programming to local retail agronomists.
o	The Truterra Transformation Agronomy Network will be made available to all farmers who signed carbon services agreements in 2021 and in 2022. The purpose of the network is to provide specialized agronomy assistance and support of both network retail agronomists and farmers directly to troubleshoot any production issues as farmers transition to regenerative cropping systems. 
o	A pilot partnership with FarmRaise organization will provide specialized, one-on-one assistance to growers interested in financial assistance to support practice transition.
o	Targeted, on-site conservation agronomy assistance will be deployed through the Federation of Southern Cooperatives to bolster accessibility of both technical and financial assistance to black and historically underserved farmers in the region.  
","Truterra will maintain a buffer pool representative of the vintage and risk profile of the portfolio  “ current target based on projections is 29% of delivered CDR tonnage  “ to address recourse associated with both avoidable and unavoidable risk. The portfolio approach allows us to balance risk at a project level, so that fields earlier in the transition are balanced with fields and growers more seasoned in the transition and therefore lower risk. As projects are registered, additional credits will be committed to the registry as appropriate to protect against unavoidable reversals. As the portfolio mix is structured to be rebalanced periodically throughout the long-term relationship, the buffer will be adjusted according to Microsoft s portfolio preferences.

Additionally, Truterra is investigating other strategies to manage risk of reversal more aggressively without incorporating claw-back clauses for farmers in contracts, which we believe to be a perverse incentive to project participation. In addition to the buffer/insurance pool, other risk management alternatives under consideration include a farmer transition warranty program, as well as buffer pools consisting of riparian/set-aside acres in cropland agricultural fields.
",Buffer pool will be comprised of Soil Organic Carbon CDR from this project.,"Current target is 29% of delivered CDR tonnage, but can be rebalanced in accordance with the risk profile of the portfolio as that develops over the course of multiple delivery years",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Ideal outcome would be a 5+ year agreement to build for scale while maintaining some flexibility to collaboratively adjust the portfolio of credits to meet Microsoft's needs and evolve with the marketplace. 
The FY22 deliverable would be set by the selection of Project 1A or 1B, with FY23-FY27 being renegotiable annually to set portfolio targets, weighting for either durability and lower risk or hedging for registration of credits in future years with a potentially higher cost and risk profile. 
Minimum annual volume of 150,000 tons and maximum growing over time to in excess of 1,000,000. We would consider up to a 10-year agreement, assuming flexibility to rebalance as noted. ","Price per ton would need to be adjustable to match market evolution and needs, given competition for growers and acres. ","This project will use two approaches for the quantification and verification of GHG fluxes: biogeochemical modeling and in-field sampling. Remote sensing will be used to verify practices as reported, but all data used to originate modeling is collected at a field level from the grower and the grower s trusted retail advisor. 

For this project, the DayCent model, version 4.5 (December 2016) will be used for the quantification of SOC at the field level, and N2O emissions from fertilizer and cover crop use at the project level. To confirm that SOC concentrations increase in the soil and support field-level model calibration, representative samples are required. Soil sampling data will be stratified based on three factors: 1) soil strata; 2) management strata; 3) climate strata.

Weather information for the specific year will be used to calculate the SOC increases in each year of the project. Direct quantification will be conducted at least once every 5 years during the project period. The baseline assessment is determined by collecting field-level data documenting the  pre-intervention � practices. This data is used along soil samples to validate the DayCent model and estimate the historic GHG fluxes associated with the project. 
",3142712,0.741,rate change balanced by portfolio approach - varies annually and regionally,"Water stewardship, ecosystem protection, and climate resilience. ","A 2019 National Academy of Sciences report contends that restoration of agricultural soil carbon could simultaneously help resolve three global problems  “ food security, biodiversity, and climate change. When carbon is restored to agricultural soils by building soil organic matter, it makes the soils more fertile, better at retaining water and fertilizer, and more resilient to climate change. In addition to SDG-13- Climate action, measurable co-benefits include: 
1.	SDG 06- Clean water and sanitation- Decreased nutrient runoff and soil erosion from fields and reduced impact on related water bodies
2.	SDG 15- Life on land- Reduction of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers
","Truterra understands the importance of encouraging and enabling carbon market access for diverse, historically under-served farming populations. Addressing this need will be a growing focus of our work to engage and support growers in a transition to regenerative agriculture. We recently began engaging with the Federation of Southern Cooperatives to explore opportunities for improving technical assistance available to Black landowners and farm operators. In addition, we are collaborating with the American Farmland Trust, which has established an outreach program aimed at female land owners specifically.","As the carbon removal marketplace in agriculture evolves, with many new offers and players entering the marketplace, there is significant risk of this marketplace driving perverse outcomes due to a misalignment of resources and incentives with the challenges of regenerative agricultural practice adoption. 

One major risk to the evolution of this marketplace and to the scaling of regenerative agriculture as a climate solution is that some farmers may be encouraged to jump into new practices without the necessary agronomic and educational support to help ensure they are able to successfully integrate the new practices into their operation. Financial incentives alone are not enough and if a farmer attempts conversion and fails, this is not only a social harm to that farmer and farm community, but it is an environmental harm through the carbon storage reversal. Further, this is not a short-lived issue, as farmers that have this experience are highly unlikely to re-enter the market or retry the failed practices. Thus, that lost farmer or field is likely to be lost from the marketplace and the regenerative effort for multiple years, potentially through that entire generation of farm management. 

A second risk involves the current market definition of additionality, in which the market considers additionality as the initial attempt at a new practice rather than the integration and establishment of that practice as a successful transition to long-term adoption. With that narrow definition of additionality, there may be a perverse incentive for recent adopters of regenerative practices to reverse those practices to gain eligibility for the marketplace, thus releasing carbon that would have otherwise been stored. Additionally, this increases the avoidable reversal risk by forcing enrollment in the marketplace prior to farmers having reasonable certainty that they will maintain the new practices long-term. 

Through Truterra s program and partnership structure, we are mitigating both risks by building the agronomic and educational support network to improve success rates and durability among enrolled farmers. Going well beyond providing a technology and market engagement pathway to sell carbon, we are building the necessary infrastructure to scale regenerative agriculture by working with and expanding the support mechanisms and advisory channels farmers already know and trust to support improvements to their operational efficiency and productivity. Further, by engaging growers who have begun to demonstrate establishment of regenerative practices as well as those attempting these practices for the first time, we are building resilience and durability into credits generated while also building the peer-to-peer educational network to transfer knowledge and create momentum for scale.

Vanga Blue Forest Community Based Organisation (VBF-CBO),Yes,Reducing carbon emissions through mangrove forest conservation,Mangroves solution,Coastal blue carbon (removal only),,,,"Mangroves in Kenya, cover 61,000 ha and provide numerous ecosystem goods and services including; (i) Capturing and storing huge stocks of carbon, (ii) Nursery and breeding grounds for fish and other wildlife and (iii) Shoreline protection from strong storms and waves.

These mangroves have however been threatened by both human and natural factors with a 12% reduction in mangrove coverage witnessed between 1991- 2016 in Vanga bay. Over-dependence by the adjacent communities who exploited the forest for wood and non-wood products has been one of the major pressures. In order to reverse this trend, the local community of the Vanga, Jimbo and Kiwegu villages, through a community-based organization - Vanga Blue Forests (VBF), was assigned 460 ha (or 10%) of the adjacent mangroves for carbon offsetting. The objectives of the project are to; restore the degraded mangroves of Vanga through community participation, enhance community capacity on co-management of mangrove areas, prevent continued emissions from deforestation and degradation and promoting long-term socio-economic development of local communities.

The project is delivered through a thirteen member community representatives committee, a Project Coordinator recruited from the community and two forest scouts. Planning and implementation of the work plan is achieved through a participatory approach which also includes the presence of marginalized groups of women and youth. Income generated from sale of carbon credits is used to support a population of 8700 people on local development projects including water and sanitation, education, health and environmental conservation.

	
Funds obtained from the successful acceptance of this project are intended for establishment of nature-based enterprises such as beekeeping for alternative livelihood sources for the community, and establishment of micro-credit schemes which will provide a long term socio-economic support especially during the current financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Our key partners in running the project are; (i) Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), who provide technical support through community training sessions on mangrove management approaches and carbon offset projects. (ii) Kenya Forest Service who manage the forests in Kenya. 
	
The tenure rights of the project are derived from the Forest Conservation and Management Act (2016) of the laws of Kenya which promote community participation in conservation and forest management. This was facilitated through establishment of a Community Forest Association (CFA), development of Participatory Forest Management Plan (PFMP) of the area and the signing of a Forest Management Agreement (FMA) between KFS and the CFA.

","The project was formed as a result of the Vanga community s own interest and will in undertaking carbon offsetting after seeing their neighboring community in Gazi bay, Kenya impacting livelihoods and conserving their natural heritage through such an intervention. Through the Forest Conservation and Management Act (2016) of the Laws of Kenya which promotes community participation in conservation and forest management, the Vanga Jimbo and Kiwegu Community went into a co-management agreement with the mandate government agency, KFS, under which they earned their carbon rights. A user group known a Vanga Blue Forest Community Based Organisation was formulated under the co-management umbrella to trade the carbon.
Development of the project was preceded by a series of consultative meetings and open forums with communities at Vanga, Jimbo and Kiwegu to appraise on the project requirement and   the project obtained sufficient start-up funds from organization such as Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation, UNEP and GEF that supported the project development process, payment of its employees salary (Project Coordinator and two Forest scouts), accreditation visit and Markit fees on the initiation year (2020) of operation.

Likelihood
Medium: there is a modest likelihood of changes because after every five years, a review will advise on the best way forward in the project and this may bring changes. New administrators may bring about change


Impact
Low: administrative changes can affect the project negatively especially if the changes are not acceptable to the administrators and the community. However change is not a risk if managed well; rather inability to change and adapt is a more serious risk

Mitigation measures
The community who have participated in all the stages of project development will be continuously advised on any changes in the project management including skill enhancement for coping with the changes. The community co-ordinator will be recruited from the community and be part of it, and will be the key player in instituting administrative changes

b) Maintenance of community support is not sustained

Likelihood
Low: This may arise especially when project activities fail to deliver expected livelihood benefits. However, the existence of similar successful projects nearby helps put expectations in perspective. The project team has an excellent track record in involving the community and avoiding elite capture, and will pursue site based research on benefit sharing to monitor and understand these risks.

Impact
Medium: a waning in community support could lead to some members withdrawing membership which will negatively impact project implementation

Mitigation measures
Prioritised local development projects represent interests of all members of the community. A mechanism for resolution of conflicts and disputes will be put in place. The community barazas represent a tried and tested method of gauging local support and are well known to local people

c) Over reliance on external support to implement

Likelihood
The likelihood of this happening is low since a qualified PC will be recruited and awareness and capacity building on the project will be on going.

Impact
Medium: an unqualified PC lacking skills to run the project and a community without awareness and skills for management of carbon offset projects could lead to slowing down project activities or neglect of some thus leading to reversal


Mitigation measures
Skill development for project coordinator. There will be continued training on PES as well as on forest carbon monitoring, reporting and verification.

3.	An unqualified project coordinator lacking skills to run the project and a community without awareness and skills for management of carbon offset projects could lead to slowing down project activities or neglect of some.
4.	Inadequate management including poor organisation and mobilisation of the community.Extreme climate events (e.g. El Nia±o) which have caused flooding and death of mangroves in Vanga in the past.
5.	Pest and disease infestation which may lead to death and low recovery of the forest.
Forest restoration and avoided degradation are known to increase forest integrity and thus functionality. This would reduce the identified risks such as the impacts of extreme weather events. Delivery of livelihood benefits, as seen in a sister project, sustains community support and project management. This is further improved by transparent processes of conflict resolution and benefit sharing. None of the VBF project activities increases the identified risks.
",A risk buffer was quantified using the scale set out by Plan Vivo and based on expert judgment. The risk buffer is modelled at 20% (for non-permanence) and 5% (for leakage) to allow for any of the identified risks and any additional uncertainties. This value is discounted from the total annual carbon benefit for the VBF area.,"The buffer pool comprises of impact and likelihood as key components which are based on expert judgement derived from six years  experience of running a similar project at Gazi. Hence whilst they are inevitably subjective they are contextually relevant and are conservative, over-estimating the likelihood of these risks.
The risk buffer for the risks modelled with default parameters was rounded up to 20 % to allow for additional uncertainties.

"Woodgas Pyrolytics, Inc.",Yes,RoCC kilns transform Kenyan biomass into biochar for sequestration,RoCC kiln biochar in  Kenya,Biochar,,,,"**** Paul Anderson s patent-pending RoCC kiln is beginning its first commercial use in Bungoma, Kenya with implementation partner Gilbert Mwangi.  The tonnes of biochar created from sustainable biomass refuse are being mixed with compost and manure for agricultural benefits with multi-century carbon dioxide removal and storage (CDRS).  [NOTE: The  S � on CDRS emphasizes that the removal also accomplishes long-term storage that is an improvement upon the relatively short carbon removal permanence of  nature-based forestry (AR) and soil organic carbon (SOM) which are major  CDR technologies.] 
****  Financing via the sale of CDRS units is needed to cover the costly first year start-up expenses that include rigorous laboratory testing of charcoal/biochar/char,  demonstration plots, meticulous data collection (using the CERCS CharTrac app), verification by multiple entities, and ultimate certification.  The land being used belongs to local small  farmers who must clear invasive species and excessive crop residue (stems and stalks), much of which would have been openly burned.  Instead, the farmers now gain biochar for their fields; Biochar already has moderate acceptance in Bungoma County.  
**** The RoCC kilns are locally fabricated and licensed to Mwangi s Biochar Pamoja ( Biochar Together �) business the keeps the available kilns in maximum usage and assures proper MR (measurement and reporting) of activities that range from biomass sourcing and pyrolysis to holding, preparation, and ultimate sequestration of biochar in soil.  Use of the RoCC kilns is by contracts that assign the rights for carbon marketing to Woodgas Pyrolytics which is responsible for applicable costs that  include V (verification) and final certification, registration, marketing, and retirement of CDRS units.    
****  The OBJECTIVES are  to demonstrate and prove credible 1) that use of RoCC kiln technology is acceptable to typical farmers (in western Kenya and then beyond) for 2) the  production of appropriately tested beneficial biochar from low-value biomass with 3) realistic financial sustainability with increased farmer income and other SDG benefits while 4) establishing credible MRV methods for accomplishing true CDRS in ways that 5) can be replicated and scaled up to gigatonne levels throughout developing societies while 6) stimulating RoCC kiln development for larger units and for affluent societies.
","A key person in the project s governance structure is Paul S. Anderson, PhD.  He invented and owns the patented RoCC kiln technology, owns Woodgas Pyrolytics, and has the most experience with the technology.  He utilizes his close contacts with networks of friends and experts who are  empowered by delegation of authority or ownership for the implementation of RoCC kiln technology in diverse countries.  Anderson  is guided by principles of fairness, justice and societal wellbeing that can be reviewed when requested.  He is further introduced here:
***   Dr. Anderson is internationally known as Dr TLUD, one of the  pyroneers � of 21st Century micro-gasification.  Since his 2003 retirement (after 30 years of university teaching of geography and mapping science), he has worked full-time on micro-gasification issues, including fuels, pyrolysis, char production, uses of heat (especially for cooking), and uses of char (especially for biochar into soils).   He has attended or conducted more than twenty week-long stove camps, biochar camps, and hands-on workshops on six continents.  Based on efforts since 2014, he developed in 2019  “ 2021 the RoCC kilns that enable biochar production in mid-scale quantities, for which he has a patent (pending).  From his base in Illinois (USA), he assists people and projects around the world.  His biosketch can be found on page 50 of his white paper  Climate Intervention with Biochar � that is available at  www.woodgas.energy/resources    .
**** Dr. Anderson has several roles in the Kenya Biochar Pamoja project, including: 1) Inventor and patent owner of the RoCC kiln; 2) owner of Woodgas Pyrolytics that authorizes the making and use of the RoCC kilns;  3) friend and initial financial sponsor of Gilbert Mwangi who is sole proprietor of Biochar Pamoja, the  operational partner of the project starting in Bungoma, Kenya, 4) friend and advisor to James Schoner, owner of Bitmaxim Laboratories (Champaign, IL) that is contracted to provide the digital MRV (CERCS CharTrac) and related features of the CERCS app ecosystem, and 5) maintaining substantial networks of contact with other individuals and organizations that will be readily assisting when there is a reasonable financial basis for project expansion.  Dr. Anderson is also responsible for financial contacts to obtain funding for current efforts and appropriate hiring of managerial expertise.   
**** Our management capacity can be evaluated at two levels.   The second (later) level is for large scale up projects with thousands of units and millions of CDRS tonnes sequestered.  For that we will hire with highly competitive salaries the best personnel and facilities that we can find for each of the myriad of administration and management tasks, including CDRS certification.  That is the easy part when the implementation details are known and the money is readily offered because the activities are profitable.  
**** The first level of management (now)  is where our current team shines with great capacities.   We have experience with small and delicate work with impoverished people in tradition-bound communities with needs that require care and  understanding.   We know the struggles of working with limited funding, and we produce success.  Furthermore, we also have the vision that what we are accomplishing can (with adaptations) be beneficial to over 400 million small farmers worldwide. 
","*** While he worked from 2001 to 2015 to develop and establish the TLUD micro-gasifier stoves that make less than one kg of biochar per day per household, Paul Anderson was aware of the lack of options for making larger (but still mid-scale) quantities of biochar in low-cost user-friendly devices.  The right combination of features came together in  late 2019 and led to his patent (pending) in 2020.  The Rotatable Covered Cavity (RoCC) kiln fills an important gap in the sizes of pyrolytic technology (as described in Anderson s publications at www.woodgas.energy/resources ). The RoCC kiln technology is operational in diameters of 2, 3, 4, and  6 feet and is proposed for CDRS projects.      
*** In November 2019 Dr. Anderson built the second RoCC kiln while in Kenya, assisted by Gilbert Mwangi who was then employed in a micro-gasifier cookstove project.  Covid-19 stopped any progress in 2020, but in  May of 2021 Anderson and Mwangi teamed up to initiate commercial RoCC kiln efforts in  Kenya, this time in Bungoma County where Anderson had previous contacts with biochar projects.     
*** The project history is also impacted by the awakening around the world of the need for long-term carbon dioxide removal with long-term storage and the resultant encouragement by Microsoft of projects such as what is proposed.  Two years ago, there was no RoCC kiln technology nor Microsoft financial encouragement to launch a biochar project in Kenyan agriculture;  and two years from now would be a significant loss of time.  The history of this project includes being in the right place at the  right time for all concerned.  This and related biochar projects for carbon dioxide removal and storage (CDRS) are at a crucial time for demonstrating how agriculture by subsistence farmers can favorably impact the lives of the poorest billions on Earth while helping prevent climatic disaster on a planetary scale.
**** The project began making and storing biochar in late July 2021.  We have data on how much biochar can be produced by one barrel-size RoCC kiln during harvest seasons (two per year).  But we do not know yet about the other six months.  [Therefore, our volume offerings are conservative; they could be multiple times larger quantities.]
",7/20/2021,Bungoma,Bungoma County,Kenya,1000,1000,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60,100,"Our project could later add emission reduction credits, but this proposal only refers to removals of CO2e.    The reason for this is the time needed to establish the net reduction of CO2 emissions  from decaying field residues in tropical latitudes.    In contrast, our calculations of carbon removals are clearly known because they are based on physical measurement of tangible measured quantities of charcoal (biochar) and the results of chemical tests of the  percentage of fixed / stable carbon.",Yes,Other (please specify),Woodgas Institute,N/A,,,No,"All the removal tonnes will have physically taken place and the documentation will  have been provided to independent verifiers (plural).   However, verification does not equal certification, which must correspond to externally specified rules that are not yet finalized for biochar CDRS.  We will work to have strong evidence that full certification is justified.
     We would like to say  Yes, to the maximum extent possible �.   However, when a new technology is being used, and because the specifics of  biochar as CDRS � itself are still questioned by some, the verification processes can have additional complications and even legalistic imposed  standards � for ultimate certification.   Furthermore, nobody knows what expenses will be associated with the immature (evolving) standards and expected methods for verification.  Some such as the VERRA methods for biochar are currently being written, and the lack of experience of the independent evaluators with such verifications can cause delays.  Full  transparency will be provided for all verification and certification processes.


","*** 1.  Burning:  Biochar could be burned after weighing and recording (digital record creation) .   This risk will be minimized with tracking from biomass to biochar to burial that is accomplished with CERCS mobile apps, field procedures, and sufficient personnel. This is especially Important in the first year(s).
*** 2.  Bureaucracy:   The previously mentioned rules and standards for verifications and especially final certifications can  disrupt delivery of results.   Also, permissions from regulatory authorities for innovative work related to fire and  emissions can be difficult to obtain.   These could be cases of well-intended desire for the perfect being the enemy of accomplishing the good.  
*** 3.  Force majeure:   For example, COVID-19 could impact the people who are essential to this project and cause delays in the timetable.   Also, socio-political unrest at local or national levels could disrupt the plans.

",1000,500,"Except for the risk of being burned, raw biochar could sit for thousands of years, basically like coal that stays in a coal mine.   However, there are advantages of placing biochar into soils where it is exposed to physical and biological agents such as microbes and fungi.  But even in soil, biochar is recalcitrant to rapid decomposition for well over five hundred years. We base our expected  durability term on the  published (but not universally accepted nor consistent) findings of the IPCC, IBI, EBC and the scientific literature.  Physical reversals are discussed in the next response boxes.","*** Our biochar is to be thinly dispersed into soils.  There are no existing scientific tests of permanence of specific deposition of carbon into soils, in large part because soil organic carbon (SOM) becomes indistinguishable from elemental carbon during test procedures that require high heat.  
*** As much as we would like to state that there will be monitoring of the biochar sequestration for 500 or 1000 years from now (being to either year 2521 or 3021), nobody can guarantee such monitoring.   A mere 250 years in the past (year 1771), Benjamin Franklin would not have been able to guarantee with confidence that even the United States Government (not yet formed then) or any existing business would be able to check on something guaranteed to exist to 2021. We will do our best efforts to comply with whatever arrangements are finalized.
","There are two major threats of reversal:
**** 1)  Burning of the created biochar.  We mitigate against this by having a short time period and rigorous surveillance between supervised (and documented) production until the biochar is rendered to be unburnable.  [There is no specific verrb for this in the English language, i.e., to  unburnableize �]  Once created and quantified, our char is to be sufficiently damp that it cannot burn without significant efforts for drying.    
**** 2)  Bioochar thinly dispersed into soil is unburnable.  But it can undergo very slow decomposition.  We estimate the half-life to be between 500 and 1000 years, well beyond the short timeframe for the World s currently needed carbon removal efforts.  We will accept the discount rate of 50% for 500 years if Microsoft will purchase our biochar-based Carbon Dioxide Removal and Storage (CDRS) tonnage at double the price that we are asking.    

",The compensation would be through a project-level buffer pool to be negotiated.  Note that any loss of sequestered carbon (biochar) because of fire prior to the biochar being rendered  unbunable � would not ever have been offered to Microsoft because our definition of sequestered carbon requires it to be into soil or permanent substances such as asphalt when certified.,"All of the carbon credits in the buffer pool would come from this project.   All would be true carbon removal tons, and none from emission reduction (avoidance) tonnes.","Concerning the suggested half-life of 500 years (which would be a discount rate of 50% for 500 years), half of the CDRS units could be placed into a long-term holding folder in a registry-level buffer pool if Microsoft would purchase half of our offered biochar-based Carbon Dioxide Removal and Storage (CDRS) tonnage at double the price that we are asking.  It is a trade-off that we are happy to discuss. ",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Thank you for asking for our  ideal outcome from this  proposal. �  We are  a new enterprise with a very promising new technology that we are applying in impoverished communities.  We are literally at the frontiers of applied science.   That means that we must do some further development work that includes refining our physical devices and using them for actual biochar production.  We would like to have a guaranteed loan or investment for such expenses, instead of relying on estimating elevated prices of promised CDR tonnes as our source of development capital.   We  would like to know how much advanced purchase funds of the future years we can obtain for use in our initial year or two.  We would like to offer a multi-year contract, but projections at this time would be speculative.  We heard Elizabeth Willmott speak at very recent webinar panels about Microsoft interest in contracts.   Without advanced payments to cover the expenses of significant early-year efforts when production is low, offtake contracts merely help us seek loans from doubting bankers or investments from risk-adverse skeptics with financial means. ","The price per metric tonne of CO2e could go from US$250 down to 100 USD as we gain experience and increase production. The selling of the physical biochar is not included in these prices, only the sequestered, monitored and verified removal certificates for carbon drawdown. ",,,,,"	Biochar is well known for its water holding capacity, reduction of need for fertilizer, filtration of water, enhancement of soil, etc. 
	Our project relates to the following co-benefits defined by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
	** SDG 1:  Poverty is reduced via the local creation of paid employment for carbon dioxide removal and storage (CDRS). 
	** SDG 2:  Less hunger via increased food production because the soils are improved.
	** SDG 3:  Better health through more food production and cleaner air.
	** SDG 4 and 5: (Education and gender equity can be indirectly benefited by the financial flows of this proposal.)
	** SDG 6:  Biochar can benefit water filtration and  septic systems before final sequestration into soils.
	** SDG 7:  Sustainable thermal energy benefits via pyrolysis will become evident in subsequent expansions of the project.
	** SDG 8 and 9:  RoCC kiln usage creates job opportunities for local people.
	** SDG 10 and 16:  Sales of CDRS units help transfer funds from the affluent to the impoverished, reducing inequalities while improving prospects for justice and peace.
	** SDG 11 and 12:  Sustainable cities can include pyrolysis of their urban refuse and encourage responsible consumption as the biochar programs expand.
	** SDG 13:  Reduced air pollution is climate action beyond carbon removal.
	** SDG 14:  Improvement of water quality in ponds and rivers can be assisted by the addition of biochar, (but that is not a focal  issue of this project).
	** SDG 15:  Strengthening soils improves life on land.
	** SDG 17:  The RoCC kiln biochar project builds partnerships between small farmers and large corporations (and all in between) for accomplishing the goal of saving our planet.
","The efforts by many people to understand the cascading co-benefits for biochar production and use is a collective  work in progress. �   The multitude of benefits of biochar are currently grossly underestimated and even ignored.   Our project will contribute both measured results for some benefits and suggest methods of measurement for others.  Especially when dealing with agriculture, time is expressed as growing seasons for seeing measurable impacts.  Our sites and datasets will be open for others to participate in these evaluations.","*** Definition 1 :  If our definition of Â« populations in and around the project area Â» is restricted to 100 or even 200 kilometers radius, th  the vast majority of that population is the same (not diverse because almost all are low-income black Africans) and has equality (in that all are in relative poverty), and lacks diversity except in their local languages.
*** Definition 2:  If we define Â« populations in and around the project area Â» as including the developed countries, then this project in Kenya is focused on inclusion of very impoverished people who gain in equity by financially sharing in benefits from affluent societies and  thereby have enhanced diversity by including African farmers who would otherwise not be part of the needed global effort for resolving the climate issues.   
*** We prefer the second paragraph to describe our project as having diversity while enhancing equity and  inclusion. 
","We are alert to watch for and mitigate potential environmental and  social  harms,  but there are no serious issues seen thus far.  The minimizing of smoke from the RoCC kilns is an operational goal, but the smoke is from the start so much less than from the current practice of open burning in fields.",,,,,,

However, verification does not equal certification, which must comply with externally specified rules that are not yet finalized for CDRS via biochar.  We will work to have strong evidence so that full certification is justified.
    We would like to say  Yes, to the highest level possible �.   However, when a new technology is being used, and because the specifics of  biochar as CDRS � itself are still questioned by some, the verification processes can have additional conditions beyond our control.   Furthermore, nobody knows what expenses will be associated with the immature (evolving) standards and expected methods for verification.  Some such as the VERRA methods for biochar are currently being written, and the lack of experience of the independent evaluators with such verifications can cause delays.  Our advanced, digital MRV scheme includes independent, third-party reviewer access to all raw data from our field operations, derived data, analyses, and visualizations (dashboards and reports).   Full  transparency will be provided throughout all verification and certification processes.
     Regarding certification follow up, raw data, derived data, analyses, and visualizations (dashboards and reports) are available to independent, third-party evaluators who have been given reviewer access to CERCS CharTrac and the CERCS Registry, key apps in our digital MRV scheme. .  There is currently no scientific literature specific to the empirical validation of RoCC kiln yields, but relevant documents about biochar measurement and verification are available from the IPCC, GS, VERRA, IBI, USBI, EBC, Puro.earth, and others.
      Regarding Ex Post Verification:  Removal tonnes are pre-allocated and reserved in the CERCS Registry under Microsoft ownership.  As daily field operations yield sequestration data through CERCS CharTrac, that data is matched to unique reserved removal tonnes, fulfilling removal tonne reservations and triggering ex post verification processes.","*** 1.  Burning:  Biochar could be burned after immutable digital records are created by CERCS CharTrac.   Our field operations personnel use the CERCS CharTrac mobile app to track our biochar from production to its placement into soil.   This includes scanning barcoded and/or QR coded container seals, recording location information (GPS coordinates), and submitting chain-of-custody (digital) signatures.  Before the biochar is placed into soil, we guard against its combustion by ensuring the biochar is not stored hot or dry or unprotected.  We may optionally inoculate the biochar, possibly mixing it with compost or manure, which further helps guard against combustion.  
*** 2.  Bureaucracy:   The previously mentioned rules and standards for verifications and conditions for final certifications can  disrupt delivery of those final certifications.   Also, permissions from regulatory authorities for innovative work related to fire and  emissions  and biochar could introduce difficulties.   
*** 3.  Force majeure:   For example, COVID-19 could impact the people who are essential to this project and cause delays in the timetable.   Also, socio-political unrest at local or national levels could disrupt the plans.
",1000,500,"Apart from the risk of being burned, raw biochar can remain relatively intact, holding its carbon for thousands of years, basically like coal that stays in a coal mine.  And to re-fill a mine would be costly and without any co-benefits.  However, there are specific advantages (crop productivity gains and  proximity  “ low transport costs  “ to the  place of pyrolysis) to placing biochar in soils where it is exposed to physical-chemical forces and biological agents such as microbes and fungi.  And even in soil, biochar is very stable (recalcitrant to rapid decomposition) for well over five hundred years. We base our expected  durability term on the  published (but not universally accepted nor consistent) findings of the IPCC, IBI, EBC and relevant scientific literature.  Physical reversals are discussed in the next response boxes.

","*** The final and necessary step for registering a carbon removal (carbon sequestration unit) in the CERCS Registry happens when CERCS CharTrac collects or is provided evidence and/or credible attestation of biochar being thinly dispersed into soils.  Beyond that, there are no existing scientific tests of permanence of specific deposition of solid carbon into soils, in large part because soil organic carbon (a component of soil organic matter) becomes indistinguishable from elemental carbon during test procedures which utilize high heat.  
*** As much as we would like to state that there will be monitoring of the biochar sequestration for 500 or 1000 years from now (being to either year 2521 or 3021), nobody can guarantee such monitoring.   A mere 250 years in the past (year 1771), Benjamin Franklin would not have been able to guarantee with confidence that even the United States Government (not yet formed then) or any existing business would be able to check on something guaranteed to exist to 2021. We will do our best efforts to comply with whatever arrangements are finalized.
","There are two major threats of reversal:
**** 1)  Burning of the created biochar.  We mitigate against this by having a short time period and rigorous surveillance between supervised (and documented) production until the biochar is rendered to be unburnable.  [There is no specific verb for this in the English language, i.e., to  unburnableize �]  Immediately after our biochar is created and quantified, we guard against its combustion by ensuring that it is never stored hot or dry or unprotected.   In fact, the biochar is stored sufficiently damp so that it cannot burn without significant efforts for drying.    Additionally, we may optionally inoculate the biochar, possibly mixing it with compost or manure, further helping to guard against combustion.  
**** 2)  Biochar thinly dispersed into soil is unburnable.  But it can undergo very slow decomposition.  We estimate the half-life to be between 500 and 1000 years, well beyond the short timeframe for the World s currently needed carbon removal efforts.  We will discuss a discount rate of 50% for 500 years.

","The compensation would be through a project-level buffer pool to be negotiated.  Note that any loss of sequestered carbon (biochar) due to fire prior to the biochar being rendered  unburnable � poses no risk to Microsoft s investment, as our definition of sequestered carbon requires placement into soil or permanent substances such as asphalt before it can be certified. ","All of the carbon credits in the buffer pool would come from this project.   All would be true carbon removal tonnes, and none from emission reduction (avoidance) tonnes.","Concerning the suggested half-life of 500 years (which would be a discount rate of 50% for 500 years), half of the CDRS units could be placed into a long-term holding folder in a registry-level buffer pool. ",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Thank you for asking for our  ideal outcome from this  proposal. �  We are  a new enterprise with a very promising new technology that we are applying in impoverished communities.  We are literally at the frontiers of applied science.   That means that we must do some further development work that includes refining our physical devices and using them for improved biochar production.  We would like to have a guaranteed loan or investment for such expenses, instead of relying on estimating elevated prices of promised CDR tonnes as our source of development capital.   We  would like to know how much advanced purchase funds of future years we can obtain for use in our initial year or two.  We would like to offer a larger and longer multi-year contract, but projections at this time would be speculative.  We heard Elizabeth Willmott speak at very recent webinar panels about Microsoft interest in contracts.   Without advanced payments to cover the expenses of significant early-year efforts when production is low, offtake contracts merely help us seek loans from doubting bankers or investments from risk-adverse skeptics with financial objectives. ","The price per metric tonne of CO2e could go from US$250 down to 100 USD as we gain experience and increase production. The selling of the physical biochar is not included in these prices, only the sequestered, monitored and verified removal certificates for carbon drawdown. 

",,,,,"	Biochar is well known for its water holding capacity, reduction of need for fertilizer, filtration of water, enhancement of soil, etc. 
	Our project relates to the following co-benefits defined by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
	** SDG 1:  Poverty is reduced via the local creation of paid employment opportunities for carbon dioxide removal and storage (CDRS). 
	** SDG 2:  Less hunger via increased food production because the soils are improved.
	** SDG 3:  Better health through more food production and cleaner air.
	** SDG 4 and 5: (Education and gender equity can be indirectly benefited by the financial flows of this proposal.)
	** SDG 6:  Biochar can benefit water filtration and  septic systems before final sequestration into soils.
	** SDG 7:  Sustainable thermal energy benefits via pyrolysis will become evident in subsequent expansions of the project.
	** SDG 8 and 9:  RoCC kiln usage creates job opportunities for local people.
	** SDG 10 and 16:  Sales of CDRS units help transfer funds from the affluent to the impoverished, reducing inequalities while improving prospects for justice and peace.
	** SDG 11 and 12:  Sustainable cities can include pyrolysis of their urban refuse and encourage responsible consumption as the biochar programs expand.
	** SDG 13:  Reduced air pollution is climate action beyond carbon removal.
	** SDG 14:  Improvement of water quality in ponds and rivers can be assisted by the addition of biochar, (but that is not a focal  issue of this project).
	** SDG 15:  Strengthening soils improves life on land.
	** SDG 17:  The RoCC kiln biochar project builds partnerships between small farmers and large corporations (and all in between) for accomplishing the goal of saving our planet.

See the ""Summary..."" comparative document attached at the end.  
     *** Paul Anderson s patent-pending RoCC kiln is proposed for commercial use in California.  The Implementation Partner is Applied Biomass Technicians LLC (ABT), led by Thor Bailey, a California biomass activist for four decades.
     *** The tonnes of biochar will be created from sustainable biomass from many agricultural and forestry sources, with special attention to areas that have been burned by forest fires.  An important part of this  project is to be compliant and sustainable regarding the  myriad of California regulations that relate to biomass, air quality, fire risk, safety, and labor.  The biochar is extinguished and rendered unburnable (mixing with water, compost, manure, soil, etc.) with soil/agricultural benefits as well as benefits of carbon dioxide removal and multi-century storage (CDRS).  
     ***  Financing via the sale of CDRS units is needed to cover costly first year start-up expenses that include rigorous laboratory testing of charcoal/biochar/char,  demonstration plots, meticulous data collection (using the CERCS CharTrac app), verification by multiple entities, and ultimate certification.  The source biomass could be on federal, state, or private property.   
     *** The first 4-ft diameter RoCC kiln was fabricated in Chico, California in February 2020, at the very beginning of the COVID-19 disruption.   The ABT will keep the available kilns in maximum usage and assure proper MR (monitoring and reporting) of activities ranging from biomass sourcing and pyrolysis to holding, preparation, and ultimate sequestration of biochar in soil.  Use of the RoCC kilns is governed by contracts that assign the rights for carbon marketing to Woodgas Pyrolytics and/or the  Implementation Partner ABT which are responsible for applicable costs that  include V (verification) and final certification, registration, marketing, and retirement of CDRS units.    
     ***  The OBJECTIVES demonstrate and prove credible 1) that use of RoCC kiln technology is acceptable for operation in western USA forest and crop areas for 2) the  production of appropriately-tested, beneficial biochar from low-value biomass with 3) realistic financial sustainability which increases local income and other SDG benefits while 4) establishing credible MRV methods for accomplishing true CDRS in ways that 5) can be replicated and scaled up to gigatonne levels throughout similar ecosystems while 6) stimulating RoCC kiln development for more units for more CDRS.
","     *** A key person in the project s governance structure is Paul S. Anderson, PhD.  He invented and owns the patented RoCC kiln technology, owns Woodgas Pyrolytics, and has the most experience with the technology.  He utilizes his close network of friends and experts (including many in California) who are  empowered by delegation of authority or ownership for the implementation of RoCC kiln technology in their geographic areas.  Anderson  has a longstanding reputation for being guided by principles of fairness, justice and societal wellbeing.  He is further introduced here:
     ***   Dr. Anderson is internationally known as Dr TLUD, one of the  pyroneers � of 21st Century micro-gasification.  Since his 2003 retirement (after 30 years of university teaching of geography and mapping science), he has worked full-time on micro-gasification issues, including fuels, pyrolysis, char production, uses of heat (especially for cooking), and uses of char (especially for biochar into soils).   He has attended or conducted more than twenty week-long stove camps, biochar camps, and hands-on workshops on six continents.  Based on efforts since 2014, he developed in 2019  “ 2021 the RoCC kiln, a patent pending device that enables biochar production in mid-scale quantities.  From his base in Illinois (USA), he assists people and projects around the world.  His biosketch can be found on page 50 of his white paper  Climate Intervention with Biochar �  (available at  www.woodgas.energy/resources )   .
     *** Dr. Anderson has several roles in the Californian biochar project, including: 1) Inventor and patent owner of the RoCC kiln; 2) owner of Woodgas Pyrolytics which authorizes the making and use of the RoCC kilns;  3) friend of Thor Bailey;  4) friend and advisor to James Schoner, owner of Bitmaxim Laboratories (Champaign, IL) which is contracted to provide the digital MRV (CERCS CharTrac) and related features of the CERCS app ecosystem, and 5) maintaining substantial networks of contact with other individuals and organizations that will be readily assisting when there is a reasonable financial basis for project expansion.  Dr. Anderson and the ABT are responsible for financial contacts to obtain funding for current efforts and appropriate hiring of managerial expertise.   
     *** Our management capacity can be evaluated at two levels.   The second (later) level is for large scale up projects with thousands of units and millions of CDRS tonnes sequestered.  For that we will hire and competitively compensate the best personnel and facilities that we can find for each of the myriad of administration and management tasks, including CDRS certification.  
     *** The first level of management (now)  is where our current team shines with great capacities.   Thor Bailey has extensive experience working with people in California.   We know the struggles of working with limited funding, and we produce success.  Furthermore, we are motivated by the knowledge that what we are accomplishing can (with adaptations) be beneficial to biomass providers, communities, and businesses while assisting the worldwide efforts to solve the climate crisis.
     *** For the extremely important work of MRV, James Schoner, director of Bitmaxim Laboratories (Champaign, IL), is contracted to provide laboratory testing services, quality procedures (QA/QC), and the mobile apps (CERCS CharTrac and the CERCS Registry) to implement our digital MRV scheme along with related features of the CERCS app ecosystem.
","     *** While he worked from 2001 to 2015 to develop and establish TLUD micro-gasifier stoves that make less than one kg of biochar per day per household, Paul Anderson was aware of the lack of options for making larger (but still mid-scale) quantities of biochar in low-cost user-friendly devices.  From 2014 to 2019 his experiments were with flame-cap kilns in partially covered barrels that did not rotate.  
     *** The right combination of features came together in late 2019 and led to Anderson s patent (pending) in 2020.  The Rotatable Covered Cavity (RoCC) kiln fills an important gap in the sizes of pyrolytic technology (as described in Anderson s publications at www.woodgas.energy/resources ). The RoCC kiln technology is shown to be operational in diameters of 2, 3, 4, and  6 feet and is proposed for CDRS projects.   The California project with RoCC kilns will begin with and focus on 4-ft diameter kilns, but will be alert to the advances of larger kilns being refined and tested in the Quebec project of Cbiochar LLC.   
     *** The project history is also impacted by the awakening around the world of the need for carbon dioxide removal with long-term storage and the resultant encouragement by Microsoft of projects such as what we are proposing.  Two years ago, there was no RoCC kiln technology nor Microsoft financial encouragement to launch a biochar project anywhere;  and two years from now would be a significant loss of opportunity.  The history of this project includes being in the right place at the  right time for all concerned.  This and related biochar projects for carbon dioxide removal and storage (CDRS) are poised to demonstrate at this critical moment how local area woodlands and forests can provide biochar to help prevent climatic disaster on a planetary scale.
     *** The project in California will begin making and storing biochar in late 2021 when hurdles of funding and bureaucracy are overcome.    Our volume offerings are conservative; they could be much larger.

On environmental justice.  One of the greatest injustices to coastal communities is overfishing.  AUPs provide food security by enhancing fish production to address this core injustice. Stakeholder consultations with fishers have been positive, given the AUPs help produce more fish.  ","Many want to know the risks of artificial upwelling pumps, so we asked Professor Andreas Oschlies from the German Marine research institute in Kiel Germany. He kindly gave us this statement that we wish to provide to you in its entirety, provided this topic's importance.

â€œThere is essentially no environmental risk associated with small-scale field trials. For hypothetical large-scale deployment, local oxygenation of subsurface waters by translocation of surface waters and deeper waters will be accompanied by translocation of nutrients and heat, likely leading to cooling and enhanced biological productivity of surface waters. Enhanced productivity will eventually be followed by enhanced respiration and oxygen consumption that may to some extent offset the initial oxygen gain. Enhanced biological productivity will likely enhance the productivity of higher trophic levels including fish. There will be shifts in the ecosystem, the valuation of which is difficult, but with higher productivity in normally not over-productive waters, these will most likely be viewed positively. It cannot be ruled out that species of little commercial value or possibly even toxic algae may benefit more than others. Mechanisms of such ecological shifts are poorly understood and based on current knowledge there is little expectation that shifts will differ from natural shifts observed when moving from oligotrophic to more eutrophic conditions, such as usually found further onshore.â€�

Specific risks often cited and our comments include:

Harmful algae blooms. These most often occur in near-shore highly perturbed ocean regions such as adjacent the Mississippi River outflow into Gulf of Mexico. Our AUPâ€™s are deployed free-drifting hundreds miles out in the open ocean, far away from these regions.

Worsening acidification. As mentioned by Prof. Riebesell, the upper ocean impact should â€œremain more or less the sameâ€�. Mid and deep ocean impacts are uncertain and our BIO-ARGO data will be helpful in discerning this."

     ***  Financing via the sale of CDRS units is needed to cover costly first year start-up expenses that include rigorous laboratory testing of charcoal/biochar/char,  demonstration plots, meticulous data collection (using the CERCS CharTrac app), verification by multiple entities, and ultimate certification.  The source biomass is mainly from federally funded projects to cut invasive species.   
     *** The second 4-ft diameter RoCC kiln was fabricated in Brandfort, South Africa in July 2020.   The project will include activities ranging from biomass sourcing and pyrolysis to holding, preparation, and ultimate sequestration of biochar in soil.  Use of the RoCC kilns is governed by contracts that assign the rights for carbon marketing to Woodgas Pyrolytics which, with Implementation Partners Fourie and Lello, is responsible for applicable costs that  include V (verification) and final certification, registration, marketing, and retirement of CDRS units.    
     ***  The OBJECTIVES demonstrate and prove credible 1) that use of RoCC kiln technology is acceptable for operations in southern African rural areas for 2) the  production of appropriately-tested, beneficial biochar from negative value invasive  species biomass with 3) realistic financial sustainability which increases local income and other SDG benefits while 4) establishing credible MRV methods for accomplishing true CDRS in ways that 5) can be replicated and scaled up to gigatonne levels throughout similar ecosystems while 6) stimulating RoCC kiln development for more units for more CDRS.
","     *** A key person in the project s governance structure is Paul S. Anderson, PhD.  He invented with Gary Gilmore and owns the patented RoCC kiln technology, owns Woodgas Pyrolytics, and has the most experience with the technology.  He utilizes his close network of friends and experts who are  empowered by delegation of authority or ownership for the implementation of RoCC kiln technology in their geographic areas.  Anderson  has a longstanding reputation for being guided by principles of fairness, justice and societal wellbeing.  He is further introduced here:
     ***   Dr. Anderson is internationally known as Dr TLUD, one of the  pyroneers � of 21st Century micro-gasification.  Since his 2003 retirement (after 30 years of university teaching of geography and mapping science), he has worked full-time on micro-gasification issues, including fuels, pyrolysis, char production, uses of heat (especially for cooking), and uses of char (especially for biochar into soils).   He has attended or conducted more than twenty week-long stove camps, biochar camps, and hands-on workshops on six continents.  Based on efforts since 2014, he developed in 2019  “ 2021 the RoCC kiln, a patent pending device that enables biochar production in mid-scale quantities.  From his base in Illinois (USA), he assists people and projects around the world.  His biosketch can be found on page 50 of his white paper  Climate Intervention with Biochar �  (available at  www.woodgas.energy/resources )   .
     *** Dr. Anderson has several roles in the South African biochar project, including: 1) Inventor and patent owner of the RoCC kiln technology; 2) owner of Woodgas Pyrolytics which authorizes the making and use of the RoCC kilns;  3) friend of Dave Lello and  Paul Fourie;  4) friend and advisor to James Schoner, owner of Bitmaxim Laboratories (Champaign, IL) which is contracted to provide the digital MRV (CERCS CharTrac) and related features of the CERCS app ecosystem, and 5) maintaining substantial networks of contact with other individuals and organizations that will be readily assisting when there is a reasonable financial basis for project expansion.  Dr. Anderson and the two Implementation Partners are responsible for financial contacts to obtain funding for current efforts and appropriate hiring of managerial expertise.   
     *** Our management capacity can be evaluated at two levels.   The second (later) level is for large scale up projects with thousands of units and millions of CDRS tonnes sequestered.  For that we will hire and competitively compensate the best personnel and facilities that we can find for each of the myriad of administration and management tasks, including CDRS certification.  
     *** The first level of management (now)  is where our current team shines with great capacities.   David Lello is an experienced business executive.   We know the struggles of working with limited funding, and we produce success.  Furthermore, we are motivated by the knowledge that what we are accomplishing can (with adaptations) be beneficial to biomass providers, communities, and businesses while assisting the worldwide efforts to solve the climate crisis.
     *** For the extremely important work of MRV, James Schoner, director of Bitmaxim Laboratories (Champaign, IL), is contracted to provide laboratory testing services, quality procedures (QA/QC), and the mobile apps (CERCS CharTrac and the CERCS Registry) to implement our digital MRV scheme along with related features of the CERCS app ecosystem.
","     *** While he worked from 2001 to 2015 to develop and establish TLUD micro-gasifier stoves that make less than one kg of biochar per day per household, Paul Anderson was aware of the lack of options for making larger (but still mid-scale) quantities of biochar in low-cost user-friendly devices.  From 2014 to 2019 his experiments were with flame-cap kilns in partially covered barrels that did not rotate.  
     *** The right combination of features came together in  late 2019 and led to Anderson s patent (pending) in 2020.  The Rotatable Covered Cavity (RoCC) kiln fills an important gap in the sizes of pyrolytic technology (as described in Anderson s publications at www.woodgas.energy/resources ). The RoCC kiln technology is shown to be operational in diameters of 2, 3, 4, and  6 feet and is proposed for CDRS projects.  
     *** On 30 June 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, Paul Fourie of Brandfort, South Africa contacted Paul Anderson about the integrated topics of biochar, invasive / alien species, and job creation.   Fourie s abilities with fabrication of machinery made possible his making a 4-ft diameter RoCC kiln and using it for biochar production.  Together with Gary Gilmore of the  Pennsylvania RoCC Biochar project, they are defining the physical refinements for RoCC ease of use (loading, rotating, unloading, char handling, etc.) in this important mid-size bracket.    
     *** The project history is also impacted by the awakening around the world of the need for carbon dioxide removal with long-term storage and the resultant encouragement by Microsoft of projects such as what we are proposing.  Two years ago, there was no RoCC kiln technology nor Microsoft financial encouragement to launch a biochar project anywhere;  and two years from now would be a significant loss of opportunity.  The history of this project includes being in the right place at the  right time for all concerned.  This and related biochar projects for carbon dioxide removal and storage (CDRS) are poised to demonstrate at this critical moment how local area woodlands, forests, and invasive species can provide biomass to turn into biochar to help prevent climatic disaster on a planetary scale.
     *** The project in South Africa been occasionally making and storing biochar since July 2020, and is prepared for more intense use as of September 2021.    Our volume offerings are conservative; they could be much larger.
",7/15/2020,Brandfort,Free State Province,South Africa,1000,1000,Yes,4000,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60,100,"Our project could later add emission reduction credits, but this proposal only refers to removals of CO2e.    The reason for this is the time needed to establish the net reduction of CO2 emissions from decaying residues of alien and invasive species.    In contrast, our calculations of carbon removals are clearly known because they are based on physical measurement of quantities of charcoal (biochar) and laboratory tests that determine the  percentage of fixed / stable carbon.",No,Other (please specify),Woodgas Institute,N/A,,,No,"    All of the removal tonnes will have been physically processed and the documentation will  have been provided to independent verifiers (plural).   However, verification does not equal certification, which must comply with externally specified rules that are not yet finalized for CDRS via biochar.  We will work to have strong evidence so that full certification is justified.
    We would like to say  Yes, to the highest level possible �.   However, when a new technology is being used, and because the specifics of  biochar as CDRS � itself are still questioned by some, the verification processes can have additional conditions beyond our control.   Furthermore, nobody knows what expenses will be associated with the immature (evolving) standards and expected methods for verification.  Some such as the VERRA methods for biochar are currently being written, and the lack of experience of the independent evaluators with such verifications can cause delays.  Our advanced, digital MRV scheme includes independent, third-party reviewer access to all raw data from our field operations, derived data, analyses, and visualizations (dashboards and reports).   Full  transparency will be provided throughout all verification and certification processes.
     Regarding certification follow up, raw data, derived data, analyses, and visualizations (dashboards and reports) are available to independent, third-party evaluators who have been given reviewer access to CERCS CharTrac and the CERCS Registry, key apps in our digital MRV scheme. .  There is currently no scientific literature specific to the empirical validation of RoCC kiln yields, but relevant documents about biochar measurement and verification are available from the IPCC, GS, VERRA, IBI, USBI, EBC, Puro.earth, and others.
      Regarding Ex Post Verification:  Removal tonnes are pre-allocated and reserved in the CERCS Registry under Microsoft ownership.  As daily field operations yield sequestration data through CERCS CharTrac, that data is matched to unique reserved removal tonnes, fulfilling removal tonne reservations and triggering ex post verification processes.
","*** 1.  Burning:  Biochar could be burned after immutable digital records are created by CERCS CharTrac.   Our field operations personnel use the CERCS CharTrac mobile app to track our biochar from production to its placement into soil.   This includes scanning barcoded and/or QR coded container seals, recording location information (GPS coordinates), and submitting chain-of-custody (digital) signatures.  Before the biochar is placed into soil, we guard against its combustion by ensuring the biochar is not stored hot or dry or unprotected.  We may optionally inoculate the biochar, possibly mixing it with compost or manure, which further helps guard against combustion.  
*** 2.  Bureaucracy:   The previously mentioned rules and standards for verifications and conditions for final certifications can  disrupt delivery of those final certifications.   Also, permissions from regulatory authorities for innovative work related to fire and  emissions  and biochar could introduce difficulties.   
*** 3.  Force majeure:   For example, COVID-19 could impact the people who are essential to this project and cause delays in the timetable.   Also, socio-political unrest at local or national levels could disrupt the plans
",1000,500,"Apart from the risk of being burned, raw biochar can remain relatively intact, holding its carbon for thousands of years, basically like coal that stays in a coal mine.  But to re-fill a mine would be costly and without any co-benefits.  Fortunately, there are specific advantages (crop productivity gains and  proximity  “ low transport costs  “ to the  place of pyrolysis) to placing biochar in soils where it is exposed to physical-chemical forces and biological agents such as microbes and fungi.  And even in soil, biochar is very stable (recalcitrant to rapid decomposition) for well over five hundred years. We base our expected  durability term on the  published (but not universally accepted nor consistent) findings of the IPCC, IBI, EBC and relevant scientific literature.  Physical reversals are discussed in the next response boxes.

","*** The final and necessary step for registering a carbon removal (carbon sequestration unit) in the CERCS Registry happens when CERCS CharTrac collects or is provided evidence and/or credible attestation of biochar being thinly dispersed into soils.  Beyond that, there are no existing scientific tests of permanence of specific deposition of solid carbon into soils, in large part because soil organic carbon (a component of soil organic matter) becomes indistinguishable from elemental carbon during test procedures which utilize high heat.  
*** As much as we would like to state that there will be monitoring of the biochar sequestration for 500 or 1000 years from now (being to either year 2521 or 3021), nobody can guarantee such monitoring.   A mere 250 years in the past (year 1771), Benjamin Franklin would not have been able to guarantee with confidence that even the United States Government (not yet formed then) or any existing business would be able to check on something guaranteed to exist to 2021. We will do our best efforts to comply with whatever arrangements are finalized.

","There are two major threats of reversal:
**** 1)  Burning of the created biochar.  We mitigate against this by having a short time period and rigorous surveillance between supervised (and documented) production until the biochar is rendered to be unburnable.  [There is no specific verb for this in the English language, i.e., to  unburnableize �]  Immediately after our biochar is created and quantified, we guard against its combustion by ensuring that it is never stored hot or dry or unprotected.   In fact, the biochar is stored sufficiently damp so that it cannot burn without significant efforts for drying.    Additionally, we may optionally inoculate the biochar, possibly mixing it with compost or manure, further helping to guard against combustion.  
**** 2)  Biochar thinly dispersed into soil is unburnable.  But it can undergo very slow decomposition.  We estimate the half-life to be between 500 and 1000 years, well beyond the short timeframe for the World s currently needed carbon removal efforts.  We will discuss a discount rate of 50% for 500 years.
","The compensation would be through a project-level buffer pool to be negotiated.  Note that any loss of sequestered carbon (biochar) due to fire prior to the biochar being rendered  unburnable � poses no risk to Microsoft s investment, as our definition of sequestered carbon requires placement into soil or permanent substances such as asphalt before it can be certified. ","All of the carbon credits in the buffer pool would come from this project.   All would be true carbon removal tonnes, and none from emission reduction (avoidance) tonnes.","Concerning the suggested half-life of 500 years (which would be a discount rate of 50% for 500 years), half of the CDRS units could be placed into a long-term holding folder in a registry-level buffer pool. ",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Thank you for asking for our  ideal outcome from this  proposal. �  We are utilizing the most promising new pyrolysis technology for mid-scale biochar production to help prevent the pending  climate disaster.  We are literally at the frontiers of applied science with appropriately simple low-cost technology. We would like to consider receiving a grant or a guaranteed loan or direct instead of relying on estimating elevated prices of promised CDR tonnes as our source of development capital.   We  would like to know how much advanced purchase funds of future years we can obtain for use in our initial year or two.  We are able to offer a multi-year contract with projections.  We heard Elizabeth Willmott speak at very recent webinar panels about Microsoft interest in contracts.   Without advanced payments to cover the expenses of putting TLUD stoves into households, offtake contracts merely help us seek loans from doubting bankers or investments from risk-adverse wealthy skeptics with their financial objectives. ","The price per metric tonne of CO2e could go from US$250 down to US$100 as we gain experience and increase production. The selling of the physical biochar is not included in these prices, only the sequestered, monitored and verified removal certificates for carbon drawdown",,,,,"1.  Biochar is well known for its soil and agriculture benefits:
	water holding capacity, 
	securing of nutrients for later release, 
		(reduction of need for fertilizer),
		(less nutrient pollution of waterways), 
	removal of  heavy metals / filtration of water, 
	benefits for soil microbes,
	enhancement of soil structure, 
	associated increase in soil organic matter (i.e., increased CO2 removal )
	supplement in feeds for cattle and chickens,
	odder reduction in  feedlots, pens, and coops,
	other aspects still being studied / discovered.
2.  Increase income for

	 refuse � of biomass processing (nut shells, slabs, slash, stover, etc.)
	demolition debris (selective, based on  contaminations � such as paints) 
	invasive species
	alien species
4. Release of pyrolytic thermal energy (if the use of heat is appropriately close) 
5.  In the context of South Africa as an merging economy, the benefits for helping achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are also to be favorably considered.  ","The efforts by many people to understand the cascading co-benefits for biochar production and use are a collective  work in progress. �   The multitude of benefits of biochar are currently grossly underestimated and even ignored.   Our project will contribute both measured results for some benefits and suggest methods of measurement for others.  Especially when dealing with agriculture, time is expressed as multiple growing seasons for adequately seeing measurable impacts.  Our sites and datasets will be open for others to participate in these evaluations over extended periods.","We are open to all opportunities for improvement of divesity, equity and inclusion, which is certainly of national interest in South African projecs.   Job creation with appropriate wages and incentives and empowerment of disadvantaged persons is a high priority for our  project.","We are alert to watch for and mitigate potential environmental and  social  harms, but there are no serious issues seen thus far.  The minimizing of smoke from the RoCC kilns is an operational goal, but even the current level of smoke is much less than that of the on-going practice of open burning in fields.",,,,,"On Climate Equity.  We believe our technology is the fastest-scaleup, lowest-cost approach to reducing atmospheric CO2 and therefore has the best potential to overcome climate inequities.

On livelihoods and community benefit.  By establishing multiple factories in port cities, we expect to provide an economic boost to these areas, which often are underprivileged.

On diversity.  Our hiring practices will actively keep our team diverse as we expand into production, deployment, and monitoring.  

On environmental justice.  One of the greatest injustices to coastal communities is overfishing.  AUPs provide food security by enhancing fish production to address this core injustice. Stakeholder consultations with fishers have been positive, given the AUPs help produce more fish.  ","Many want to know the risks of artificial upwelling pumps, so we asked Professor Andreas Oschlies from the German Marine research institute in Kiel Germany. He kindly gave us this statement that we wish to provide to you in its entirety, provided this topic's importance.

â€œThere is essentially no environmental risk associated with small-scale field trials. For hypothetical large-scale deployment, local oxygenation of subsurface waters by translocation of surface waters and deeper waters will be accompanied by translocation of nutrients and heat, likely leading to cooling and enhanced biological productivity of surface waters. Enhanced productivity will eventually be followed by enhanced respiration and oxygen consumption that may to some extent offset the initial oxygen gain. Enhanced biological productivity will likely enhance the productivity of higher trophic levels including fish. There will be shifts in the ecosystem, the valuation of which is difficult, but with higher productivity in normally not over-productive waters, these will most likely be viewed positively. It cannot be ruled out that species of little commercial value or possibly even toxic algae may benefit more than others. Mechanisms of such ecological shifts are poorly understood and based on current knowledge there is little expectation that shifts will differ from natural shifts observed when moving from oligotrophic to more eutrophic conditions, such as usually found further onshore.â€�

Specific risks often cited and our comments include:

Harmful algae blooms. These most often occur in near-shore highly perturbed ocean regions such as adjacent the Mississippi River outflow into Gulf of Mexico. Our AUPâ€™s are deployed free-drifting hundreds miles out in the open ocean, far away from these regions.

Worsening acidification. As mentioned by Prof. Riebesell, the upper ocean impact should â€œremain more or less the sameâ€�. Mid and deep ocean impacts are uncertain and our BIO-ARGO data will be helpful in discerning this."

A mere 250 years in the past (year 1771), Benjamin Franklin would not have been able to guarantee with confidence that even the United States Government (not yet formed then) or any existing business would be able to check on something guaranteed to exist to 2021. We will do our best efforts to comply with whatever arrangements are finalized.
","There are two major threats of reversal:
**** 1)  Burning of the created biochar.  We mitigate against this by having a short time period and rigorous surveillance between supervised (and documented) production until the biochar is rendered to be unburnable.  [There is no specific verb for this in the English language, i.e., to  unburnableize �]  Immediately after our biochar is created and quantified, we guard against its combustion by ensuring that it is never stored hot or dry or unprotected.   In fact, the biochar is stored sufficiently damp so that it cannot burn without significant efforts for drying.    Additionally, we may optionally inoculate the biochar, possibly mixing it with compost or manure, further helping to guard against combustion.  
**** 2)  Biochar thinly dispersed into soil is unburnable.  But it can undergo very slow decomposition.  We estimate the half-life to be between 500 and 1000 years, well beyond the short timeframe for the World s currently needed carbon removal efforts.  We will discuss a discount rate of 50% for 500 years.

","The compensation would be through a project-level buffer pool to be negotiated.  Note that any loss of sequestered carbon (biochar) due to fire prior to the biochar being rendered  unburnable � poses no risk to Microsoft s investment, as our definition of sequestered carbon requires placement into soil or permanent substances such as asphalt before it can be certified. ","All of the carbon credits in the buffer pool would come from this project.   All would be true carbon removal tonnes, and none from emission reduction (avoidance) tonnes.","Concerning the suggested half-life of 500 years (which would be a discount rate of 50% for 500 years), half of the CDRS units could be placed into a long-term holding folder in a registry-level buffer pool. ",FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"Thank you for asking for our  ideal outcome from this  proposal. �  We are utilizing the most promising new pyrolysis technology for mid-scale biochar production to help prevent the pending  climate disaster.  We are literally at the frontiers of applied science with appropriately simple low-cost technology. We would like to consider receiving a grant or a guaranteed loan or direct instead of relying on estimating elevated prices of promised CDR tonnes as our source of development capital.   We  would like to know how much advanced purchase funds of future years we can obtain for use in our initial year or two.  We are able to offer a multi-year contract with projections.  We heard Elizabeth Willmott speak at very recent webinar panels about Microsoft interest in contracts.   Without advanced payments to cover the expenses of putting TLUD stoves into households, offtake contracts merely help us seek loans from doubting bankers or investments from risk-adverse wealthy skeptics with their financial objectives. ","The price per metric tonne of CO2e could go from US$250 down to US$100 as we gain experience and increase production. The selling of the physical biochar is not included in these prices, only the sequestered, monitored and verified removal certificates for carbon drawdown",,,,,"1.  Biochar is well known for its soil and agriculture benefits:
	water holding capacity, 
	securing of nutrients for later release, 
		(reduction of need for fertilizer),
		(less nutrient pollution of waterways), 
	removal of  heavy metals / filtration of water, 
	benefits for soil microbes,
	enhancement of soil structure, 
	associated increase in soil organic matter (i.e., increased CO2 removal )
	supplement in feeds for cattle and chickens,
	odder reduction in  feedlots, pens, and coops,
	other aspects still being studied / discovered.
2.  Increase income for 
	suppliers of forest slash
	suppliers of sawmill slabs
	the workforce for pyroysis (job creation)
3.  Disposal of undesirable biomass, such as
	 refuse � of biomass processing (nut shells, slabs, slash, stover, etc.)
	demolition debris (selective, based on  contaminations � such as paints) 
	invasive species
4. Release of pyrolytic thermal energy (if the use of heat is appropriately close) 

","The efforts by many people to understand the cascading co-benefits for biochar production and use are a collective  work in progress. �   The multitude of benefits of biochar are currently grossly underestimated and even ignored.   Our project will contribute both measured results for some benefits and suggest methods of measurement for others.  Especially when dealing with agriculture, time is expressed as multiple growing seasons for adequately seeing measurable impacts.  Our sites and datasets will be open for others to participate in these evaluations over extended periods.","We are open to all opportunities for improvement of diversity, equity and inclusion.   ","We are alert to watch for and mitigate potential environmental and  social  harms, but there are no serious issues seen thus far.  The minimizing of smoke from the RoCC kilns is an operational goal, but even the current level of smoke is much less than that of the on-going practice of open burning in fields.",,,,,"On Climate Equity.  We believe our technology is the fastest-scaleup, lowest-cost approach to reducing atmospheric CO2 and therefore has the best potential to overcome climate inequities.

On livelihoods and community benefit.  By establishing multiple factories in port cities, we expect to provide an economic boost to these areas, which often are underprivileged.

On diversity.  Our hiring practices will actively keep our team diverse as we expand into production, deployment, and monitoring.  

On environmental justice.  One of the greatest injustices to coastal communities is overfishing.  AUPs provide food security by enhancing fish production to address this core injustice. Stakeholder consultations with fishers have been positive, given the AUPs help produce more fish.  ","Many want to know the risks of artificial upwelling pumps, so we asked Professor Andreas Oschlies from the German Marine research institute in Kiel Germany. He kindly gave us this statement that we wish to provide to you in its entirety, provided this topic's importance.

â€œThere is essentially no environmental risk associated with small-scale field trials. For hypothetical large-scale deployment, local oxygenation of subsurface waters by translocation of surface waters and deeper waters will be accompanied by translocation of nutrients and heat, likely leading to cooling and enhanced biological productivity of surface waters. Enhanced productivity will eventually be followed by enhanced respiration and oxygen consumption that may to some extent offset the initial oxygen gain. Enhanced biological productivity will likely enhance the productivity of higher trophic levels including fish. There will be shifts in the ecosystem, the valuation of which is difficult, but with higher productivity in normally not over-productive waters, these will most likely be viewed positively. It cannot be ruled out that species of little commercial value or possibly even toxic algae may benefit more than others. Mechanisms of such ecological shifts are poorly understood and based on current knowledge there is little expectation that shifts will differ from natural shifts observed when moving from oligotrophic to more eutrophic conditions, such as usually found further onshore.â€�

Specific risks often cited and our comments include:

Harmful algae blooms. These most often occur in near-shore highly perturbed ocean regions such as adjacent the Mississippi River outflow into Gulf of Mexico. Our AUPâ€™s are deployed free-drifting hundreds miles out in the open ocean, far away from these regions.

Worsening acidification. As mentioned by Prof. Riebesell, the upper ocean impact should â€œremain more or less the sameâ€�. Mid and deep ocean impacts are uncertain and our BIO-ARGO data will be helpful in discerning this."
YACUMAMA FOREST CARBON PROJECT,Yes,A proactive solution to climate change and biodiversity preservation,YACUMAMA FOREST CARBON PROJECT,CO2 utilization (specify the source of the CO2),Atmospheric gases and particles,,,"     The Yacumama Forest Carbon Project is located in the upper Amazon region of Peru, with a project area of 11 square miles, and which is bisected by a navigable river - the Rio Yarapa.  The entirety of this project functions as a preserve for the pink dolphin, harpy eagle, jaguar, tapir, and 7 species of primates - all while sequestering and storing carbon in the virgin rainforest that dominates the landscape.  I began a mission to protect this area 30 years ago, with a project called the Yacumama Lodge, which attempted to put the model of eco-tourism to the test as a means of funding conservation.  10 years ago I changed the business model from eco-tourism to carbon sequestration (although it has taken some time for people to get serious about this issue.)  As a lodge and research center we hosted numerous organizations, which include the Smithsonian EarthWatch program, National Geographic, George Washington University, Children's Environmental Trust, and many more. Much of this activity made it into the press, such as, The New York Times, NBC, and the BBC.
     Our VCS PDD, Validation, and Verification as a REDD project has been carried out by Dr. Verl Emeric, who administers the Forestry Department at Virginia Tech, and who has overseen all the scientific requirements for the Project.  CDR is achieved and maintained through the application of the REDD protocols and methodologies as established by VCS.
     Payments received for CDR will initially be directed to maintenence, operations, and monitoring - however, we have another Verification to do on Approximately 500,000 credits and will need funds for site inspections and auditors.  Additional funds have been, and always will be, made available for health and education emergencies in the nearby pueblos. For the purposes of monitoring the Project Area we need to replace and upgrade our boats.
     The land use is defined in Peru as Rustica, meaning no development or habitation, and for Property Tax reasons one cannot alter this Native State of Virgin Rainforest without consequence.   The underlying forest upon which the Project is based was purchased by myself from the Peruvian Government 30 years ago and is held in Title in my name.  As this purchase was a special cutout by the Peruvian authorities, the net result is that for hundreds of miles in most directions the Project area is encircled by Federal Lands that are part of the Pacaya Sameria Reserve Protective Zone - which surrounds the Park.







 ","     As regards the YFCP, it was conceived, created, and funded by myself, Lawrence Bishop, and I am the sole Project Proponent.  As regards the 11 sq. mile Project Area, this real estate was purchased by myself in 1992 with the intent to create a lodge and research facility, which we subsequently achieved. To create the PDD as well as Validation and Verification we contracted the services of Virgina Tech - all details of this in PDD attached above.  To perform the independent Audit we employed ESI which is now Aster Global and operated by Shawn and Janice McMahon.  All of this was packaged and completed under the guidance of VCS - now Verra.  As manager of a carbon project I am constantly aware of my responsibilities in project monitoring and compliance and I call upon Verra for guidance in any of these areas should I need help.  Having spent 3 decades operating in the most remote regions of Peru, and being here now to tell about it, engenders me with the kind of experience to oversee this project.","    After assisting Rioni and the Kayapo People at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992 I was informed that people fleeing Peru and the Shining Path Revolution were liquidating assets to escape, and in particular, an owner of rainforest property. Long story short - due to a complete breakdown in civil services and no tax revenue the Peruvian Government amended the constitution for 18 months allowing for the liquidation of state assets.  Working with the military on site I was allowed to draw my own boundary map which is how I captured land on both sides of a navigable river, and unique in the presence of the Pink Dolphin. It is not possible to tell a story that is 30 years long in limited space, but I will do my best.
I began with eco-tourism as a model but quickly perceived its flaws and limitations which is why 10 years ago I sought out Dr. Verl Emrick at Virginia Tech to design my project around funding from Carbon Credits.  I financed this effort from the sale of real estate, however the climate was much different in 2012 and it took a number of years to complete.  While I have key employees in strategic locations, our greatest advantage is our 30 year relationship with our neighbors and that for more than half the population they have not known a world that doesn't include our presence, and in many many cases, our help.",1/1/2012,Nauta,Lorretto,Peru,85000,85000,Yes,100000,,100000,,100000,,100000,,100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70,100,"Methodologies and calculations are to be found in the PDD for REDD project 1133, which has been previously attached to this document, or to be found listed in the Verra Registry.

",100,100,"I am assuming that this number is related to the amount of years in a project life span, which in my case is 30 years (2012 - 2042).  In that the project has title to the underlying forest asset, it has always been our position that we inaugurate another 30 year project cycle in 2042 - which includes establishing a trust to oversee the property when I die.  I am somewhat unsure if I am adequately addressing your question, but as regards the YFCP, the plan is to preserve this asset in perpetuity, with no disturbance, and under no circumstances will this sequestered carbon ever be released. Hopefully anything I missed can be found in the PDD and Project Verification.","Monitoring our Project is a consistent but straight forward operation that yields real-time data every two weeks. Accidental fire is not an issue in the Amazon Rainforest, and for any carbon reversal to happen, intentional deforestation would have to occur - which is impossible on titled land, and additionally under Peruvian law without all proper compliance, particularly with the Forestry Dept., who have the Forest Police under their jurisdiction.  Carbon sequestration reversals with the YFCP are completely under our own control and any occurrence of such an incident is remote to nonexistent.  In the unlikely event of such an occurrence all downstream parties should, and would, be notified.  Regarding this topic in general, as a Verra Validated Project we are obligated to follow all protocols set forth by our regulatory body.","As Peru carries little to no political risk on a governmental basis, it is only local realities that one needs to address, and other than the gold mining regions in southern Peru most of the country is, and has been, tranquil for many years. The adoption of satellite imagery has allowed the Forestry agencies to monitor for poaching and illegal logging with an alarming efficiency.  Much logging is not for the sake of the timber, but to make accessible the soil for agriculture.  Having been part of the local community for 30 years, I feel more than comfortable in making the claim that intentional or unintentional carbon reversals are all but impossible.","With virtually no chance of either an intentional or unintentional carbon reversal event for the term period of the project we feel confident in our ability to deliver quality and durability to our customers.  In the unlikely event of an unintentional reversal we would commit to evaluate any customer loss and offer compensation in the form of a new issuance of credits or some other mutually acceptable tender.  Frankly, there is no excuse for an intention release of sequestered CO2, and while there should certainly be financial penalties, it more resembles criminal fraud. Additionally, as a Verra Project, I am required to maintain a 30% buffer on all credits I issue from this Project.",30% risk buffer composed of credits from this Project,30%,FY22 sale and a multi-year contract (offtake or similar),"The ideal outcome would be to arrive at a mutually beneficial carbon transaction. I am thus far impressed by your commitment to act upon your climate goals, and should you prove to be an equitable partner in this endeavor we would embrace the opportunity to engage in a multi-year contract.  We could supply 100,000 tonnes per year starting in fiscal year 2023.",For the sake of both parties Carbon Credit evaluations should be recalibrated on an annual basis - up or down.  Fairness is important in pricing and essential to a long relationship - it would seem as though neither party should be asked to commit to a price more than a year or two into the future given the unknowns surrounding the market.,,,,,"In the Amazon Rainforest water stewardship entails that you actively protect the myriad of aquatic life, and in our case, the Amazon River Dolphin as well.  If not reported to the authorities, the poaching of fresh water tropical fish can also be an issue, otherwise the water has more power over us than we have over it.  Our project produces no waste, we employ ecological closed septic system with flush toilets, composting, and remove non-biodegradable trash from the site.  Given our private ownership of the project area we are free to engage in ecosystem protection, and do.  We always work in tandem with local authorities and if actions are warranted,  we remove ourselves from the proceedings.  We are guests of Peru, it is ill advised and impolite to act with assumed authority.  We have, in the last 3 decades, hosted over 70 medical missions for Patty Webster of Amazon Promise.  In the last couple of years we have provided logistical support for Engineers without Boarders in multiple missions to install rain catchment systems in remote villages.  For PR purposes, there exists a photo library covering 30 years, which I hope to share.  Saving the Amazon rainforest is the backbone of terrestrial climate action - and in this duty we are full time employees of climate resilience.","The co-benifits above are measured in outcomes, nothing more.  We have established a baseline of operations over a long period, and can witness and record positive change measured against this over time.  In the rainforest it is often not what you do, but what you don't do - and in this case, good stewardship is just protecting the natural order from intrusion.Our","Our local populations have far more urgent needs than environmental justice, and they have custodianship of their own district and do a fair job in administration. Issues surrounding diet, health, and education dominate, and it is these areas that we assist most often.  If you do a search for Amazon Promise you can see what we do, I have supplied all logistical support for their jungle missions for nearly 25 years.  Our influence on the local populations led to the election of a woman Mayor, a first for the Amazon Basin.  We have also established two schools, a health clinic, and an area wide soccer club with shoes, uniforms, and balls - we named the prize after our river - The Yarapa Cup.","There exists no social or environmental harm or negative impact, nor the potential for it.",,,,,"On Climate Equity.
