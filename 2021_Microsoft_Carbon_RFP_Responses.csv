See i.e.  https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/global-infrastructure/geographies/#overview  At these data centers also quite some sand and pebbles are used for the construction material, parking places, water retention etc. Some of these conventional sand/pebbles can easily be replaced with olivine. With the same functionality and additionally CO2 sequestration over the lifetime of the project.  Using (locally sourced) olivine to replace the conventional sand/pebbles will result in:  - CO2 sequestration   - Starting local awareness about CO2 removal  - Starting up local business for Olivine mining/transportation  Another thought is to ask the PPA-purchases to also use olivine. I.e. as a ballast material for off-shore windparks.    GreenSand will  assist in:  - Choosing the correct material, which sequesters CO2 and full fills the normal requirements of the sand/pebbles  - Calculating the CO2 uptake over the lifetime of the data center.   - Quantifying the CO2 credits and hand them over to Microsoft.

I.e. for the Netherlands (as Olivine is already imported) or for Switzerland or Northern Italy, Southern Germany an Italian olivine mine can be used. For California and Washington there are olivine mines. So for each location a specific calculation on the availability of the mine, transportation distance can be made.  ","Carbon mineralisation is relatively new and less studied.  This is rather active in the Netherlands (various universities, knowledge institutions). But quite some documentation is in Dutch.

The  2018, across Northern Australia, there are approximately 78 savanna burning projects of which approximately one third are managed by Aboriginal ranger groups. 4,078,963 ACCU have been produced to date, with 70% of these ACCU being produced by Aboriginal savanna burning projects.  The Project is managed by the Aboriginal Carbon Foundation (ACF) that works with many indigenous groups to develop savannah management and with a variety of other creditable companies to produce beef cattle herd management and land restoration projects. The main aim of the project is to create employment for indigenous people, improving aboriginal health and social outcomes and providing opportunities for aboriginal people to utilise their traditional ecological knowledge in the projects.     ACF was established in 2010 as a not-for profit company limited by guarantee. The founding Directors were Tracker Tilmouth, David Ross (both former CEOs Central Land Council) and Allan Cooney (former CEO Centrefarm). The primarily Aboriginal Board and staff are passionate about working to build viable economies on Aboriginal lands and we are supported by a range of associates and project partners who are equally committed to supporting Indigenous people.     ACF has a strong culture of innovation and collaboration, we take risks and invest in the development of carbon products and services that benefit Indigenous people and address climate change nationally and internationally.

In contrast, all external verification of information will be undertaken by a team of trained Aboriginal experts, including rangers, Traditional Owners and community members from across the projects.   1.2.2 ABORIGINAL OWNERSHIP   Aboriginal people involved in and effected by carbon projects in Australia, and other respective countries, must lead the process of development and prioritisation of project outcomes (core-benefits) that are of highest importance to them. It is essential through this process that rangers, Traditional Owners and the people directly affected have ownership over the data identified, collected and documented and the decisions over what data is shared.   This principle is founded upon the argument that data validity is enhanced when the impact assessment of a program is responsive to the values and aspirations of the people who are affected by it. When program participants and other local citizens who are most familiar with the project contribute their wisdom and experience to the process, including data interpretation (Kirkhart, 2010), evidence validity is strengthened.   1.2.3 STRENGTHS-BASED APPROACH   A strengths-based approach to impact assessment recognises that “local people have themselves planned a project and placed it within a larger vision of what they hope their nation will be. Project evaluation can contribute to these nation-building efforts” (Robert, Jorgensen and Garrow in LaFrance and Nichols, 2010; 25).   The principle of strengths-based assessment has two important elements. The first is to identify and build upon the capacities, knowledge and assets that people already have regarding impact assessment. There are several Aboriginal communities, including communities with carbon projects that already have significant experience in different evaluation methods, for example SROI3. As well as supporting ownership of information and ensuring appropriate evaluation practice, the involvement of skilled Aboriginal people from communities implementing carbon projects can strengthen the collection and interpretation of information in the following ways:   	ensuring respect and knowledge of local research protocols when entering communities and gathering information;   	having a strong understanding of the project context and demonstrated ability to build strong relationships with participants; and   	communicating in local vernacular, ideally the languages that shape the participants and effected people’s worldviews, so that respondents are comfortable and confident to converse on an intellectual level.     In addition, this principle of strengths-based approach ensures that impact monitoring and assessment is shaped around a desire to learn and improve over time, rather than to inform rapid decisions about funding allocation. Such an approach facilitates relationships of trust, understanding and respect between the project and the investors, which are the foundations of honest and open communication. >   3. Social Return on Investment is an approach for allocating financial proxies to non-financial outcomes.    CAPACITY BUILDING   In addition to providing a rigorous and independent verification of the environmental, social and cultural values, the verification process enables capacity development of the people closest to the subject matter and their peers. Without measurement skills and ability, the participants and affected communities will remain dependent on the involvement of external people who are not as well placed to collect, interpret or communicate accurate and meaningful information about the project’s core-benefits.   The framework invests in the training of Indigenous people in verification methodologies and a 4-day nationally accredited training course teaches rangers, Traditional Owners and community members how to identify, measure and analyse environmental, social and cultural values of carbon farming using customised tools. As a result, a cadre of verifiers rangers will be established in each region who understand best the context they are verifying.   This framework ensures the skills development and income generation opportunities available to Aboriginal rangers, Traditional Owners and community people through their role as verifiers. The verification process is not designed to build the verification skills of external third-party evaluation experts to undertake audits.   1.2.5 DATA TRIANGULATION   As in all best practice impact assessment, data triangulation is essential to utilise the strengths of different approaches to data collection to promote data accuracy, verify the information and therefore build confidence in the results. Qualitative information is used to provide rich, detailed descriptions about core-benefits and their meaning for effected communities and to explore the processes through which they have been achieved.   Ultimately data triangulation will be built within this framework through a broad selection of qualitative data collection sources coupled with existing quantitative resources such as research findings (of which there are many within ranger stations).   1.2.6 COST EFFECTIVENESS   Finally, the principle of cost effectiveness recognises that the expertise of external audit organisations, while less suitable for the context as described above, is also likely to be costlier. The principles outlined above not only provide for rigorous and culturally responsive practise but are likely to reduce the costs of verification to the carbon project owners, Traditional land owners and other bodies responsible for the funding of verification.      International development principles underpinning the Core Benefits Verification Framework     Australian international development non-government organisations (ANGOs) are governed by sectoral standards to ensure accountability and credibility in their impact measurement. These standards detail processes to promote results validity and transparency to inform important funding and programming decisions. Key standards guiding the sector are:   	DFAT Monitoring and Evaluation Standard (April 2017)   	OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) codes (2000)   	Australian Evaluation Society (AES) ‘Guidelines for the Ethical Conduct of Evaluation’   	Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) ‘Principles and Guidelines for Ethical Research and Evaluation in Development (April 2016)   	BOND UK ‘Evidence Principle & Checklist’     DFAT and OECD DAC codes govern foci and process for ensuring credibility of data collected. However, AES, ACFID and Bond standards encourage best practice and enhancement of empowerment processes for participants involved in the evaluation event. Core principles outlined in these standards are: integrity; beneficence; capacity building; empowerment; respect; awareness of power relations; informed consent; privacy and confidentiality; evaluation merit and credibility; and participatory methodology.     The R&D behind the Core Benefits Verification Framework draws on these existing measurement blueprints and the expertise of international development practitioners responsible for the verification of DFAT funded projects. The rigour mechanisms promoted by the standards detailed in this section and utilised in social research methodologies are central to the Core Benefits Verification Framework.

"EBS one Pty Ltd",,"Biomass-based atmospheric CO2 removal and sequestration outside the biosphere.","EBS One","N/A","Biomass-based atmospheric CO2 removal and sequestration outside the biosphere","Our objective is to build the world’s largest, affordable, available and repeatable CDR solution; delivering:  •	A high degree of certainty about both carbon captured and its safe long-term storage,  •	Positive secondary social and environmental impacts, and  •	A new use for degraded low rainfall farmland, adversely effected by climate change and where existing uses are increasingly unsustainable.    In principle our solution is very simple:  •	Grow a multi-species selection of highly adapted, high biomass production Australian dryland, coppicing, woody plants on degraded, low rainfall, failing and previously cleared farmland,  •	Periodically trim these plants of their above ground biomass (which will regrow rapidly given their coppicing characteristic), and  •	Sequester this harvested biomass in safe long-term storage, At present this project is a start-up, wholly owned by its founders. A CDR offtake agreement with Microsoft will allow us to raise funding for a comprehensive feasibility study necessary to secure project financing and equity investment for our first commercial CDR module. The lead times are short. If we can secure a CDR offtake agreement this calendar year, first CDR is FY23 and commercial scale CDR reached by FY26.    Given the abundant supply of suitable land, our solution is highly scalable. We could be delivering over 150 million mt CDR pa from Australian-based projects alone, by 2040. The global upper limit is well over 1 billion mt CDR pa, dependent on land access and sovereign risk issues.    Our initial target area has no land access and sovereign risk issues, being freehold farmland in Western Australia. This land has been cleared for over 100 years. Our solution would essentially return the previously cleared woodland. Secure tenure is obtained by simply buying the land. If and when CDR is no longer required the land will be maintained as a native woodland, a fund having been set aside from CDR revenues for the perpetual management of this woodland and stored CO2.    An (EBS One and Microsoft) agreed, and significant, proportion of profits earned from our first module will be re-invested in EBS One’s CDR process and business performance improvement to minimize CDR costs without compromising regulatory, accreditation, environmental, customer and community obligations. We believe that a focus on cost reduction is not only good business but also that the delivery of affordable CDR, at scale, is critical to humanity’s willingness and capacity to effectively address climate change.

In fact, there are significant environmental and social co-benefits from the EBS CDR solution as set out in our response to Question 32. Note also that biomass harvesting of the type envisaged is not `deforestation` as the trees coppice and re-grow after harvest. The trees are alive and capturing atmospheric CO2 during the entire project life.     Electrical energy usage for this project is minimal, mostly for communications, measurement and monitoring systems, and on-site offices and team facilities. Solar PV and deep cycle battery powered systems will be deployed in all these cases.     EBS One will use diesel fuels to power its mobile equipment, while being alert to the potential to change to clean fuels in the future. Indeed, given that our CDR revenues will be net of the CDR used to offset of our own emissions, we have a carbon price built into our diesel fuel costs and an increased incentive for switch to clean fuels as soon as feasible.    Diesel fuel combustion is our main direct source of operational CO2 emissions. The EBS One financial model includes projections for all diesel fuel related CO2 emissions during transportation of all inputs (including diesel) to site, as well as during construction and operation of this project. These emissions are projected to be around 80,000mt CO2 over the 25-year life of the project or 0.8% of total CDR. Actual diesel fuel usage will be monitored, reported and independently audited during the course of the project. EBS One will retire CDR credits equal to the value of the emissions associated with diesel fuel use and only CDR credits net of this amount (and similar deductions) will be transferred to Microsoft. This process will be managed as part of our ICROA approved validation and certification scheme in an independent third-party managed registry.     Note also that we will use nitrogenous fertilizer because of its strong positive net impact on CDR and our project economics. As for diesel fuel, the emissions impacts of this fertilizer, in its production, transport to site and use, have been taken into account in the projections incorporate in the EBS One financial model (including a CO2 equivalent for N2O released). Again, as for diesel fuel, actual fertilizer usage will be monitored, reported and independently audited during the course of the project. EBS One will retire CDR credits equal to the value of the emissions associated with fertilizer use and only CDR credits net of this amount (and similar deductions) will be transferred to Microsoft. This process will be managed as part of our ICROA approved validation and certification scheme in an independent third-party managed registry.    While our solution should probably not be regarded as a forestry project, rather a shift from one agricultural cropping land use to another, it is worth noting that forestry and land clearing are robustly managed by governments in Western Australia and the other Australian jurisdictions, as well as being the subject of intense public scrutiny. The expansion of the agricultural region of Western Australian has been effectively banned for at least 40 years. All clearing of native vegetation is subject to a permitting process under the Environmental Protection Act (1986) administered by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation. This act applies even to remnant native vegetation on freehold farmland and it is a criminal offence to clear land without a permit. On this basis we are of the view that the change in land use we envisage under the EBS CDR solution will not influence other land use decisions taken by the Government of Western Australia.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","Not applicable","Yes","The EBS CDR solution offers significant and measurable social and environmental co-benefits. While we describe below impacts in our initial target areas in Western Australia, all similar marginal, low rainfall farming areas in Australia and around the world face similar challenges and would see similar co-benefits from the application of the EBS solution.    Social co-benefits    1. Saving communities suffering financial stress    Description: The small communities in our initial target area have been suffering long term population decline, with rising levels of debt and falling incomes and educational attainment    Measurement: All relevant historical trends and the impacts from changed land use can be tracked in detail using commercially available geospatial economic modelling based on integrated government and other datasets    2. Jobs growth  Description: Employment in our initial target area has also be in long term decline    Measurement: The relevant trends and the impacts can be tracked and unpacked in detail using commercially available geospatial economic modelling based on integrated government and other datasets    3. Transition arrangements for an aging workforce    Description: Farmers are one of Australia’s oldest workforces. Many are trapped owning marginal farms with little or no prospect of selling their farms to move into retirement or alternative employment    Measurement: Our success in buying land will be a measure of how we help farmers transition. We will also be able to survey those who sell to better understand motivations and impacts    4. Reducing impacts of social and economic stress    Description: The population in our target area has poor health and mental health outcomes, including a high suicide rate    Measurement: We anticipate that the economic and social co-benefits of our new land use will improve these health outcomes and be measurable in standard data collected by the health authorities and integrated into commercially available geospatial economic modelling    5. New opportunities for Aboriginal people    Description: Aboriginal people are the most disadvantaged group even in our target area where declining economic, social, health and educational outcomes are being experienced across the entire population    Measurement: Our plan is to actively target the economic inclusion and empowerment of Aboriginal people including a strategy for Aboriginal businesses to take controlling equity interests in some EBS projects. The impacts of this strategy will be measurable in regularly collected data    Environmental Co-Benefits    1. Redressing water and land salination  * Removal of native tree cover from our target area has resulted in the water table rising in places into the capillary action zone leading to secondary salination, particularly along valley floors and in many water courses  * Restoring tree cover will increase total plant transpiration per unit area and act to supress water tables to their original levels and limit secondary salination  * Over time rainfall events will tend to flush way non-replenishing surface and near surface secondary salination salt deposits reducing the area of land damaged by secondary salination and tending to restore water courses to their pre-clearing condition     2. Limiting desertification risks  * Depending on local conditions and farming practices marginal farmland of the type targeted can be at risk of desertification where native woodland cover is removed, particularly in the form the loss of top soils from wind and water erosion  * This risk is accentuated when economics returns are low and areas previously farmed and actively managed are abandoned  * Plantations of the kind in view will have the effect of reducing the risk of soil erosion and over time help to restore soil quality such as from the use of nitrogen fixing plants    3. Restoring native animal habitats    * Each plantation module (including about 25,000ha of harvested plantings) will have at least a further 2,500ha of land area dedicated to native woodland conservation or restoration  * No remnant vegetation on acquired properties will be cleared.

Feral animal management  * The staffing for each planation module includes at least two rangers and their roles will cover animal populations management, the removal of feral animals and the maintenance of perimeter fence integrity    5. Wild fire management  * EBS plantations will reduce fire risk and enhance fire management both in the area covered by plantations and in adjacent areas  * The EBS approach results in regular fuel load reduction. Collecting biomass, and locking up carbon is a business imperative  * The planation layout with 9m inter row machinery access zones provides multiple fire breaks and affords excellent access for firefighting teams and their equipment  * Comprehensive, continuous and automated plantation monitoring will allow for very rapid responses to in-plantation fire events such as lightning strikes  * Each plantation module will have dedicated fire equipment and teams trained in its use    ","The entire community in our initial target area is dependent directly or indirectly on the success of local farming, dominantly cereal cropping. And this is already suffering the adverse effects of climate change. The trend is to lower rainfall in the winter exotic crop (primarily wheat) growing season with increasing rainfall in the summer which is no benefit to the dominant existing land use pattern. (Total average annual rainfall is rising slightly or stable which is ideal for the mixed native species plantations we have in view.) This means that exotic crop production is progressively becoming more and more marginal and less sustainable. With resultant problems of falling incomes, employment decline, financial and community stress, and poor health and educational outcomes as outlined in our response to Question 32 of this survey.    The EBS solution offers a sustainable `new economy` land use that can underpin the revitalization of these hard-pressed communities. At base this follows from the fact that the EBS solution is a higher value land use, with revenues about double that of current land uses per unit area. And further, with grain production and exports rising in the Black Sea zone, prices for the traditional products of our initial target area are likely to be stable at best, while the prospect is for the price to rise for verified CDR. Without a solution like EBS the outlook for our initial target area is dire indeed.    And as bad as the prospects are for the community in general in our initial target area, the prospects are even worse the Aboriginal people within this community. Our approach is not to rely on trickle down benefits to improve the lot this group that has been systemically marginalised (and worse) since European settlement. Our strategy is one of economic inclusion and empowerment. Beyond a program to actively recruit and retain Aboriginal employees and preference Aboriginal businesses in procurement, we are also exploring the potential for local Aboriginal businesses to take controlling equity stakes in future EBS projects under the Australian Government’s Indigenous Investment program. The object here is to provide business investment, leadership and career opportunities that have not typically been open to Aboriginal people, and certainly not in our initial target area. It is important to note that ‘place’ particularly matters for Aboriginal people who often speak of the land they belong to, not the land that belongs to them.  ",,,,,,,,

We are a project developer that designs education and technical execution programs that support farmers to achieve soil carbon sequestration outcomes, we register projects with the regulator, manage all compliance requirements on behalf of the farmer, aggregate supply and sell credits.    Carbon Sync will launch in the south west of Western Australia through invitations for 20 graziers over a land base of 20,000 hectares to participate, following this invitation 60 mixed cropping grazing enterprises over 240,000 hectares will be invited from the Wheatbelt. Under Australian legislation only freehold land is eligible to participate in a carbon project. It is our intention to have all farms active in the program by the end of 2021.    Soil carbon sequestration is carried out in addition to existing crop and livestock production regimes. It is not a change in land use. Carbon credits represent an additional income stream for farmers that can drive enduring change to land management that will result in significant social, ecological and economic co-benefits.    Carbon Sync’s programs are designed to support farmers for the full 25-year crediting and permanence period of a carbon farming program under the Australian Emissions Reduction Fund legislation. Our models are based on farmers increasing soil carbon by 1% to 30 centimetres over 25 years. The majority of the cost of participating in the project is borne by Carbon Sync. Carbon Sync shares carbon credit revenue with the farmer, 55% of the sale price of the carbon credit is returned to the farmer.    Carbon Sync has secured significant investment through private and public investors to fund this project.    Carbon Sync has a strategy to scale with the intention to have 1,000,000 hectares enrolled by 2027.    The total addressable land base in Western Australia to deploy this program is 15 million hectares with the potential to sequester 100 to 150 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.

RAINBOW BEE EATER IS MANAGING THE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL CERTIFICATION AND TRADING PROCESS AS A JOINT VENTURE WITH HOLLA-FRESH. ","AUSTRALIAN CARBON DRAWDOWN PROJECT PIPELINE>>100KT/Y CO2-e ","Rainbow Bee Eater Pty Ltd","https://www.rainbowbeeeater.com.au/","PyCCS, Biomass conversion with pyrolysis to stabile storage in biochar","OPPORTUNITY All over the world, every year, billions of tonnes of green wastes are burned or landfilled. This is mostly invisible to those of us who live in cities - which is most of us.   Many of these residues are economically accessible and can be converted into useful forms of bio-energy for heating, drying or electricity and biochar for long term environmental services including soil and water remediation and carbon sequestration using safe 21st century, circular economy, job rich carbon negative processes.   SOLUTION Rainbow Bee Eater (RBE) is a single purpose Australian owned company formed in 2009 to “Develop and supply modular biomass to energy and biochar systems with benchmark cost, environmental and social benefits’’ With our Australian partners, RBE developed the ECHO2 system which uses a process that mimics Mother Nature to safely convert green ‘wastes’ into affordable biochar and energy. RBE understands that ECHO2 environmental and financial performance is very attractive compared to other systems currently available globally – producing a high yield of stable, high carbon biochar and clean syngas.   The first commercial demonstration of ECHO2 was commissioned in 2019 and heats the Holla- Fresh herb growing glasshouse using recycled wood provided by large local organics recycler BioGro. BioGro add the biochar to their composted products that are used for horticulture and agriculture.   Current Holla-Fresh production forecasts and a recent Life Cycle Analysis (attached) indicate that this first project will be at least 3,000 tonnes CO2-e carbon negative in FY20/21. This includes the land fill emissions avoided by using this ‘waste’ wood and excludes the reduced emissions resulting from the benefits of biochar both in the composting process and in the soil.   RBE and Holla-Fresh have recently partnered with PURO because of their verifiable voluntary market CORC mechanism for carbon drawdown that is credible to international buyers and sellers. The CORC scope excludes both the avoided emissions from land fill and from the biochar in use. We expect to generate at least 1,000 CORCs in FY20/21 and are offering 500 CORCs for this first Microsoft CDR period.   RBE has identified a pipeline of over 50 commercial energy and biochar projects in Australia each of which has similar carbon drawdown potential. Three case studies are included in the Attachments.   The credible verification offered by PURO and the secure carbon drawdown revenue offered by Microsoft will result in faster deployment of these 50 projects. ","Mt Gambier","South Australia","Australia",500,100,500,0,"7/1/2020","We have little uncertainty in the permanence of our project, because our removal is a recarcitrant, mineralized, physical storage material. For the same reason reversals are not expected in our project, because the verifier checks that the biochar is not shipped to combustive use. Generally accepted durations for biochar are 100-1000 years for biochar.  The durable storage of biochar and the carbon dioxide embodied in it can be estimated with the O:C ration received from the laboratory test. In general, a molar ratio of O:C lower than 0.2 appears to provide, at minimum, a 1000-year biochar half-life. There is a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010), which allows to calculate a duration over which 90% of carbon in the biochar remains.  Puro methodologies always contain a buffer that covers premature reversals of carbon removal. In the biochar methodology the buffer is currently between 2,5 -5% reflecting the scientifically measured quality of the biochar i.e. the O:C ratio.","Yes","Not applicable (I answered yes to Q24)",,,,,,,"Puro.earth (ICROA-approval pending)",,,"All of the 50 currently identified projects utilize local residues that would otherwise be landfilled or burned such as from plantation forestry, wood processing, woody weeds, construction, city green wastes and crop residues.   Each ECHO2 module uses ~20kW of electricity to turn drives and power control systems. At Holla-Fresh this is currently grid purchased electricity @ 0.44kg CO2-e per kWh.   The overall Holla-Fresh site usage is ~ 50kWe. RBE has installed an 80kWe gas engine powered generator to be fuelled by some of the ECHO2 syngas. This is expected to be commissioned later in 2020 and to reduce Holla-Fresh purchases from the grid by ~75%.   The recycled wood used by the ECHO2 module at Holla-Fresh is hand sorted construction and demolition wood that would otherwise be burned or landfilled. The biochar produced from the recycled wood at Holla-Fresh is suitable for use in very large scale applications that require lower cost biochar such as composting, asphalt and concrete. Because of the potential for contamination in the recycled wood, the biochar is not suitable for animal feed which requires higher cost low impurity biochar from fresh residues such as from crop and plantation forestry and timber and food processing.   Of the 50 future projects, the majority are projected to be based on fresh biomass residues.

","PyCCS systems such as ECHO2 enable the stewards of land in any region to utilise biomass residues to produce energy and biochar instead of burning or landfill.   The biochar enables many well documented environmental benefits that include soil water holding capacity, locking up environmental toxins such as heavy metals, increasing soil microbiology, improving N & P availability as well as permanent beneficial carbon drawdown.   Enabling these early commercial PyCCS projects in 1st world countries such as Australia will accelerate the learning curve on both the PyCCS technologies and the biochar applications. This will inevitably benefit developing countries.   RBE is motivated and happy to work with PURO and Microsoft to enable that transition. ",,,,,,,,

Project Drawdown has estimated that shifting towards better managed grazing practices could result 16.4 to 26 gigatons of CDR compared with conventional pasture practices by 2050. In Australia, there were 66 million sheep and 24 million cattle raised in 2019, with an average farm size of over 4000 ha.  While Australian farmers have faced many challenges related to climate change, market fluctuations and access to resources, the past 3 years have been some of the most challenging yet. The 31 months from January 2017 to July 2019 were the driest on record for the state of New South Wales, and the bushfires that raged throughout the country in 2019 damaged more than 46 million acres, and added to the significant challenge of agricultural recovery. Many farmers have had to reduce their flock size due to drought and the resulting inability for pastures to sustain flocks.     In late 2019, ClimateCare’s partner, PUR Projet, developed a model to shift livestock practices to integrated and improved grazing systems which is rooted in research, practice, and conversations with farmer networks. The regenerative design aims to empower farmers, support land restoration and resilience, and results in CDRs through multiple activities including time-controlled grazing, agroforestry, tree planting and shrub establishment.

Coastal wetlands provide important habitat and water quality benefits crucial to recover and enhancement of coastal fish stocks, including species targeted by recreational fishers and commercial fishing. Many commercially exploited fish use coastal wetlands as nurseries. Coastal fish serve as the primary protein source for people living along the coasts (particularly in developing and small island nations) and a main source of income for communities through small-medium and commercial-scale fishing operations.

Agroforestry is not the same as Afforestation; We’re planting trees not only for the purpose of carbon sequestration, but also for their produce (additional farmer income, fighting poverty), the role of trees in biodiversity, the prevention of soil degradation and the positive health effects of diversification in people’s nutrition (trees give nuts, fruit, etc.).","As part of Rabobank’s purpose and mission, the Acorn project provides long term food security for developing countries with indigenous agricultural practices and unparalleled corporate responsibility impact through carbon credits, combating climate change and land degradation. The remote sensing technologies used to measure yearly biomass increase empower subsistence smallholder farmers to sell carbon credits. These credits are generated through agroforestry, an ancient agricultural practice dislodged by Western agricultural practices. Acorn measures the carbon storage on a yearly basis, selling the credits ex post to credit buyers and paying the farmers directly, excluding layers of middle men. As we aim to provide an entry to the carbon credit market for smallholder farmers, the agroforestry projects in scope are by definition of small physical size. One of the challenges related to that small size of the plots is the economic viability of the concept for individual smallholder farmers. The increase in yearly income from growing trees needs to exceed the costs associated to generating and trading carbon credits.  For the concept to be successful, it is therefore crucial that the cost of transitioning an individual farmer to agroforestry is limited – this includes the monitoring cost. On the other hand, through monitoring, we need to reach a level of accuracy that enables us to bring the resulting (certified) carbon credits to the market with a high level of transparency and credibility. We believe the answer to finding the balance lies in using scalable, transparent and inexpensive (remote sensing) technologies, including satellite imagery.     In the coming years the Acorn program will develop thousands of projects, helping individual smallholder farmers to make the switch to agroforestry: We help them plant suitable trees and train / support them in nurturing trees to maturity. We partner with local organizations: NGO’s, farmer cooperatives, big processors (e.g. coffee, coco), governments, funds, etc. in different countries across continents. CDR is delivered through Above the Ground biomass increase (i.e. tree growth).     The 50+ smallholder farmers part of this RFP are merely a small sample of what the Acorn program will be able to deliver beyond the current start-up phase; Our ambition is to reach thousands of farmers in Q4 2020 and many more in 2021.

This is first and foremost done to accurately measure the year on year increase in biomass (as the basis for the calculation of the number of carbon credits that can be issued to the market and paid out to the farmer), but also for detection of negative biomass delta, i.e. tree removal (fire, timber). If we haven’t been informed of tree removal through the smallholder farmer or our local partners, then the periodic measurement based on remote sensing technology can and will pick up on (substantial) removal of trees and report on this.    Commitment and compensation for the Acorn program  The commitment period for the Acorn program needs to be further defined; Pilot projects with approximately 3000 farmers are planned to commence in Q4 2020 and are intended to further detail the specifications of the carbon credits that we generate – including the commitment period. It is our aim to commit to a guaranteed life span of 30 years per planted tree. As the trees are owned by the smallholder farmers, and subject to external circumstances, a safety buffer of 10% is created to guarantee this number. For this buffer, carbon credits are not brought to market. We aim to realize this either by certification through a certifying body, e.g. Verra (who maintains a shared buffer pool for all members) or by realizing our own buffer pool, with a ratio of monetized/not monetized stock equal to market standards (assumed 10%);    Commitment and compensation for sample projects in this RfP:   For the sample projects that are the source of the 500 Carbon Credits that we’re offering in this RFP, we commit to 10 years of sequestration. For the sample projects we follow the same logic for compensation as for the Acorn program in general; we reserve 10% of carbon credits for the bufferpool (i.e. we only market 90% of the biomass increase in form of carbon credits). In practice this means that for this RFP, we guarantee the generation of 556 carbon credits, 56 of which are reserved for the buffer; the remaining 500 are what we offer to Microsoft through this RFP.

We’re in contact with these parties and as they acknowledge the potential of remote sensing technology as a method to increase monitoring efficiency against reduced cost, they have expressed their keen interest to cooperate on this. In addition, we’re in the process of setting up an alliance with other market parties that have a similar interest in incorporating remote sensing in the monitoring protocols of certifying bodies. We’re developing an alternative approach for the period that incorporation of our monitoring method in protocols of certifying bodies is pending. In this approach, projects under the Acorn program would be verified by an external independent auditor (e.g. KPMG) who will review our processes, and verify the accuracy of our carbon sequestration measurements. This approach is intended to be endorsed by NGO’s such as FAO, WRI and UNEP to increase credibility to external parties. This alternative approach is intended to run in parallel to the process of incorporating our method in the protocols of certifying bodies, which is ultimately the goal.

For long smallholder farmers have been excluded to voluntary carbon markets due to high transaction, verification and monitoring costs. Meanwhile farmers have not been able to structurally invest in agricultural practices. Carbon credit revenues flow directly to the smallholder farmer.    With the Acorn agroforestry projects we aim to  balance competing land use demands in a way that is best for human well-being and the environment. It means it will have a positive impact on food and livelihoods, finance, restoration and progress towards climate and development goals. With agroforestry at scale smallholder farmers are better capable of dealing with the severe impacts due to climate change like draughts and floods.      Quotes of a farmer in Brazil:  1.	The transition to Regenerative Agroforestry systems has really helped my family and I to see that you can actually generate decent income including native Amazonian species, ensuring us food security while producing major commodities for companies.  2.	The generation of carbon credits for our Agroforestry systems can really help us with an extra income for the impact we’re having to the environment and the role we play preserving the Amazonian Rainforest. This will inspire many other farmers to transition their agriculture systems to a more nature-inclusive approach.   3.	Agroforestry have changed our life. Now we are able to produce palm oil to a cosmetics company, cocoa to a chocolate company and açaí to an international trade fruit company. Diversification is key to increase our revenue.

The proposed carbon project is in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, one of the world’s 25 Biodiversity Hotspots. Over 85% of the original forest has been deforested threatening many plants and animal species with extinction. Sixty percent of Brazil’s endangered species are found here. In total, there are 24,000 species of plants, mammals, birds, and amphibians, and reptiles, of which 9,500 species exist nowhere else on earth. Importantly, there are also countless more unknown to science.  ?	In 2019, Saving Nature started working with Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu (REGUA) to restore the Guanabara Bay watershed. REGUA now manage a 17,300-acre (7000 ha) private reserve, including 864 acres (350 ha) of forests restored with 550,000 native trees since 2005. In 2020 Saving Nature is working with Natural Capital Partners to leverage carbon finance in order to accelerate the expansion of the Atlantic Forest project.    ?	The project uses site preparation and tree planting to establish trees on degraded lands. The practice is to plant 675 native trees per acre (1667 per ha). No harvesting is allowed within the project area. The process starts with identifying which species to plant from adjacent forests exceptionally rich in plant biodiversity. REGUA works with an international consortium (Treedivnet), local universities, botanic gardens, and specialized nurseries (including the Luisa Sartori Institute) to select seeds from these, particularly healthy individuals.  ?	REGUA started planting in 2005 but with limited funding only managed to plant approximately 184 hectares from 2017 to 2020. The proposed plan is to restore a minimum of 80 hectares of land per year using at least 200 native species and maintain them through to maturity. By 2027 the plan is to have restored 834 hectares.   ?

The project is replanting 1,971 hectares of forest (nearly half the size of the island of Manhattan), while preserving an area of rainforest around the project that is nearly three times that size. This reforestation project took over land that was previously deforested for cattle grazing. The reforestation efforts not only extend critical native habitat of the Amazon but provide further employment for the community.    Unique to this project is its commitment to multi-species reforestation. The project has managed to plant 54 different native species on this land, with approximately 622 hectares of truly mixed-species plantings. Planting began in 1999 and continued until 2003. In order to supply seeds for the project a nursery was constructed on the project, and continues to operate to this day.    Pachama’s remote sensing record indicates the project is protecting land in an area of Brazil suffering from intense deforestation. The project area was deforested in the late 1980s and 90s for both cattle and coffee production, and reforestation efforts today look to change that.    The land was purchased as private property by ONF international, a French company focused on supporting forest management around the world, through their private subsidiary ONF Brazil. The lands were originally purchased in 1999 in partnership with funding from Peugeot, with the intention of creating a carbon project. ONF International is the international arm of the Office National des Forests, a public entity in France created to manage French public forests.

The loss of forests reduces earth’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, driving climate change.  The loss of habitat and the isolation of disconnected forests pushes species to extinction.  The proximity of humans and wildlife increases the opportunity for diseases to spill-over from wildlife to human populations, sparking pandemics.    Our focus on biodiversity hotspots addresses many of the cascading consequences of ecosystem destruction.  In fact, the United Nations General Assembly has also prioritized restoration of degraded and destroyed ecosystems as a proven measure to fight the climate crisis and enhance food security, water supply, and biodiversity.  In declaring 2021–2030 the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, they recognize that:  “The degradation of land and marine ecosystems undermines the well-being of 3.2 billion people and costs about 10 per cent of the annual global gross domestic product in loss of species and ecosystems services. Key ecosystems that deliver numerous services essential to food and agriculture, including supply of freshwater, protection against hazards and provision of habitat for species such as fish and pollinators, are declining rapidly.”","Our local partners do not have the funding to certify their carbon to international standards required to participate in the carbon finance market. Despite the importance of restoring and protecting tropical forests, they have been largely excluded from carbon financing due to the expense of certification.  Saving Nature provides the funding and resources needed to open access for funding that is truly a game-changer for conservation.    Restoring the environment helps underrepresented and under-resourced communities, in part by undoing the damage from deforestation. Catastrophic landslides on steep hillsides and destruction of watercourses helps no one. Healthy forests and watersheds need trees with extensive root systems that bind the soil of sloping land and absorb water to counteract wet soil.     At the core of our approach to conserving biodiversity is our commitment to building local capacity and creating employment opportunities. We partner with local NGOs to build strategic corridors that connect isolated forest fragments. These corridors allow previously isolated populations to move unencumbered. In building corridors, our projects help create demand for local small businesses that support ongoing tree planting efforts, including nurseries for growing native trees, and jobs planting and maintaining forest regeneration plots.     Longer-term, as the forests regenerate, our conservation partners hire local people, often former poachers, to monitor and protect the land from illegal activities. They also develop ecotourism and research stations as part of their ongoing operations of the protected areas we help create, monitor, and expand. Community outreach to foster stewardship for biodiversity creates jobs for local environmental educators.    Even more pressing, dispersing indigenous communities means dispensing with the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of millennia—knowledge that could lead to significant scientific and medical advances.",,,,,,,,

TREE AID has been working since 1987 across the African Drylands and has gained extensive experience in natural resource management and programming; planting and regenerating over 20 million trees since founded. TREE AID helps communities manage trees, land and water to protect the environment and biodiversity, and support their families. ","Help Build the Great Green Wall Across the Sahara","N/A",,,"The objective of the programme is to participate in building a Great Green Wall in the Sahara and the Sahel, a wide belt of biodiverse vegetation, trees and bushes, to combat desertification and restore degraded land, across five countries: Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, and Ethiopia.   In Burkina Faso, the project activities will contribute to the conservation and enhancement of the carbon potential of 21 community forests under decentralized governance and management. It will involve more than 127,000 farmers living around these forests areas and who are involved in at least 52 forest cooperatives. Located in various regions of the country and involving 20 communes, the project will be based on priority actions combining a number of measures that will enable us to achieve our results. These are agronomic measures (forest zai, scarification, forest half-moon, liquid fertiliser), plant measures (planting and sowing), and structural measures and management measures (assisted natural regeneration, local governance and decentralised management). In Ethiopia, the project has been designed in the areas of afforestation/ reforestation (A/R) that address environmental degradation, while creating a financial incentive for local communities. In Ghana, the project aims at reducing deforestation and degradation and restoring ecosystem services along selected rivers and around the Vea Dam in Northern Ghana. It will consist of three major components: 1) Income Generation from Natural Resources; 2) Land Rights and Access, and 3) Environment and Natural Resource Management. The project will facilitate the development of a set of planning, management, and capacity building tools for actors involved in the local governance of riverine forest resources, including forest users. These tools for the protection and management of each identified riverine forest will be developed using a participatory approach involving all stakeholders. In Mali, the project will contribute to reducing the vulnerability of communities to climate change through the improvement of forest cover in the Ségou region in Mali. Specifically, to improve forest cover in 24 communes of the San and Tominian circles in the Ségou region through targeted actions of land revegetation, reduction of pressure on forest resources and restoration of degraded lands. Finally, in Niger, the project will contribute to strengthening the resilience of the population living in the partial reserve of Dosso around the W Transboundary Biodiversity Reserve (WTBR), to the impacts of climate change through rehabilitation of the environment and development of the local economy.","N/A","N/A","Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger",1923000,100,0,1923000,"1/1/2021","Permanent monitoring plots are used to measure progress in terms of tree cover and biodiversity, and can be used to measure a number of indicators including seedlings planted, trees regenerated survival rates, and species diversity.

It’s a participatory approach aligned with the environmental policies of the countries we are working with. Potential negative impacts could include:  - Environmental: the realization of restoration and conservation activities of soils such as ploughs, zai, half moons, stony cords, etc. Promoting runoff infiltration and reducing water erosion requires compliance with technical standards such as level curves, material type and soil nature. Failure to comply with these techniques and means of work will instead accelerate water erosion and exacerbate the degradation of fertility and soil structure. These activities can also destroy what is left of habitat for animals and especially the soil microorganisms if the techniques of realization are not respected, alongside the loss of biomass and therefore loss of trees with the impact of increased CO2 emissions. As a mitigation action, the project anticipates the training and organisation of the beneficiaries and technicians responsible for training them and technically accompanying them in the field. The multidisciplinary project team is responsible for the ongoing monitoring on the ground and making the necessary corrections while ensuring the implementation of the social and environmental management plan.  - Social: At the social level, the possible impacts of land-related problems that can lead to social conflicts between individuals, socio-professional groups or communities around the exploitation of natural resources resulting from the project or their control. The result is low land security, which limits farmers' investment in forest and soil restoration. To prevent and address this situation, the project will develop a local governance approach to forest resources that emphasizes the consultation, awareness and mobilization of all sensitivities before any investment actions on the ground. This is done by involving traditional leaders and local elected officials from each village. Through a participatory process, a local land resource charter is developed to prevent and engage all stakeholders in a common agreement that takes into account local customary realities and government laws, laws and policies on rural land management. It is only after the adoption and disclosure of this local land charter that investment work is carried out and access to these resources is facilitated for all beneficiaries.   Climate change brings severe, multifaceted new challenges to the world’s farmers. The countries of implementation are facing increasing drought, floods and temperature and changing rainfall patterns. Smallholder farmers who depend on rain-fed agriculture are the most affected. Changes and innovation are needed to help strengthen the resilience of farmers to disasters and longer-term climate change. Gender-responsive climate-smart agriculture is an approach that supports farmers to adapt their agricultural systems to current and predicted future levels of climatic variabilities, increasing food security. It combines different sustainable practices, to sustainably increase agricultural productivity, building resilience to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or sequestrations.  In addition to generating negotiable environmental requirements, emissions-related activities have many additional benefits that are well established in ongoing projects, including: i) improving soil quality, reducing soil erosion and improving watersheds to support agriculture; (ii) giving communities access to NTFPs; and iii) increase biodiversity by restoring habitats. A capacity building programme will be deployed to improve production techniques and the integration of climate information into the management of agro-sylvo-pastoral activities. The strategies chosen in the framework of our programmes will be adapted to each local context. Among the strategies possible the project will apply these different techniques when adapted to the local context:   •	Crop management including composting and pest and disease management  •	Livestock management  •	Soil management   •	Agroforestry  •	Water conservation/management  ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","Not applicable","Not applicable","Tree planting and regeneration is a highly effective approach that contributes to combating soil fertility loss, increasing organic matter and nutrients, decreasing soil erosion, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, and dysfunctional hydrological cycles by restoring woody vegetation on degraded land. Healthier soils and greater water availability enable communities to sustainably intensify agricultural production, increasing household food security and income. More productive farmland also help to prevent further encroachment into forests. The pruning of trees through assisted natural regeneration (ANR) also provides a supply of wood, further reducing pressure on existing forests. A healthier ecosystem is more resistant to climate shocks and stresses and in turn increases the resilience of local communities.   Trees offer real opportunities for people living in poverty to earn an additional sustainable household income, contributing to a more diverse farm economy. Trees can provide fruits, nuts, oils, butters, traditional medicines and nutritious foods. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) can play an important role as a source of livelihoods for smallholder farmers. The transformation and commercialisation of sustainably sourced NTFPs such as honey, shea, baobab, and moringa, can support the development of small-scale local enterprises into profitable businesses that can provide a vital source of income for smallholder famers. NTFPs can be particularly beneficial to women and youth, in a context where livelihood opportunities for these groups can be particularly limited. The project will use the Rural Household Multi Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) tool to measure increases in incomes and improvements in household socio-economic situations. RHoMIS is a rapid, cost-effective, digital household-level survey and analytical engine for characterising, targeting and monitoring household and natural resource practices. RHoMIS collects a series of harmonised and standardised performance indicators, especially for smallholder farmers in low-income countries. We use RHoMIS to capture information at project baseline and end line on household level income, income from NTFPs, Progress out of Poverty, changes in agriculture practices, livelihood strategies as well as dietary diversity and food security.   Trees can play a vital role in fighting hunger for some of the world’s poorest people. Moringa and baobab are species shown to provide far higher levels of vitamins and minerals than other fruits and vegetables, meaning they have potential to play a crucial role in feeding malnourished families particularly in the dryland contexts where the project operates. These species can also be available all year round, and so provide an important opportunity to bridge a gap in nutrition during the lean months of the year.  The project is committed to delivering the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and build a fairer society for all. Our work contributes a number of SDGs including:  •	15 - Life on land: the programme is protecting life on land by taking action to stop the degradation of natural habitats, soil, and halt the loss of biodiversity and threatened animals and species.  •	5 - Gender equality: Our projects promote increased land access for women and female-led enterprise.   •	13 - Climate action: the programme improves education and awareness raising on climate change mitigation.  •	8 - Decent work and economic growth: the project targets this SDG though improving employment prospects for rural communities in the drylands.  •	1 – No Poverty: Central to ending poverty is ensuring that everyone has access to economic resources and land. The programme works to secure access to forest resources for the rural communities that use them to earn a living.  ","o	The initiative follows a programmatic and participatory approach based on the full participation and empowerment of beneficiaries who are rural, poor and vulnerable communities so that actions are most beneficial to them. This begins with the selection of regions and areas of intervention taking into account areas where the need for improved living conditions are expressed through various reference and socio-economic studies. For the most part, communities are facing a difficult climate and variable weather due to drought and flooding, the resulting degraded soils and the natural resources on which these 90% communities depend that are degraded and loss of biological diversity. These poor and vulnerable communities are often unaware of the global dynamics on carbon finance and therefore do not know how to take advantage of it for their well-being and environmental restoration, a source of hope for households, especially women and young people who need to believe in a brighter future).    o	The approach focuses on information and awareness in local languages on these climate change issues, starting with visible examples such as traditional knowledge of climate and weather observations that are in the midst of instability, putting families in disarray. Although all the terminologies, because of their novelty do not exist in the local language but the one to explain them exist because of the lived experiences. On the basis of this approach of awareness and discussion in focus groups (men, women, young people, socio-professionals) - each group having its own specificity - the actors themselves propose solutions that are subsequently discussed in the presence of the project technicians to ensure their relevance and technical, organisational, financial and environmental feasibility.    o	The programme works with NGOs which specialise in environmental and sustainable forest resource management and have an approach that engages both vulnerable and poor communities as well as other local actors including traditional leaders, local elected officials and state technical services. This is possible thanks to the support for a better organisation of the beneficiaries so that their representative/leaders will carry their voice and defend their specific interests at the level of municipal councils and national meetings. Technical and financial support is provided to support these communities in the implementation of projects and activities on the ground. A permanent monitoring and technical support mechanism allows each quarter and year to assess the inclusiveness of the activities and to make the required corrections as necessary. We use the Voice, Choice and Control tool to assess the level of inclusion of specific groups - especially women and young people in driving and monitoring results while taking into account local realities. Women and young people are the first actors who exploit forest and tree resources for economic, medicinal, food and firewood needs, so their involvement that we generate through awareness, organization, training and equipment support is fundamental to achieving the desired results for any project to reduce carbon emissions and improve living conditions.",,,,,,,,

Rarely does a private property of this size and ecological richness become available for sale and the Nature Conservancy Canada were competing against buyers with a commercial logging rather than conservation focus. This project pioneered carbon finance as a mechanism to further environmental stewardship and expands private land conservation at scale.  •	Had the project developer not bought the property, there would have been an immediate threat of subdivision and high-impact logging. The project therefore delivers greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits in two ways. The Darkwoods forest is avoiding the inevitable profit maximizing timber harvesting regime that a commercial logging company would have imposed on the property. The second GHG benefit comes from a conservation focused management plan that allows most of the trees to remain standing, allowing the forest to grow to maturity and directly sequester GHGs.  •	The project manages the land for conservation targets by clearly zoning and monitoring different areas of the property to target areas for: strict biodiversity protection by limiting/deactivating roads, infrastructure, and activity; public access; invasive species control, conservation research, and a low level of sustainable harvesting.

The resources of the Great Bear are vast and valuable to Coastal First Nations, environmental groups, forest companies and governments. After decades of conflict, the Nanwakolas First Nations and the Coastal First Nations have enacted landmark Government to Government agreements for land use planning and natural resource management in the Great Bear Rainforest. Together, these groups have adopted an Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) approach that values the forest not as a source of lumber alone, but as a balanced system that sustains biodiversity and an enriched community. The EBM approach that originated from the Great Bear agreements protects the forests, recognizes the ecologically and culturally significant areas, and delivers revenue opportunities, through the creation of carbon offsets, for the ongoing stewardship by the Nanwakolas First Nations and the Coastal First Nations.     This project meets the additionality, permanence and social co-benefit, verifiable standards that characterize the world’s highest quality offset projects. Without offset funds, the protected areas would not have been established and harvest levels would not have been reduced. The Great Bear Forest Carbon project resulted in changes in land-use legislation and regulation that increased carbon stocks by converting forests that were previously designated, sanctioned, or approved for commercial logging to protected forests. Emissions caused by harvesting, road building and other forestry operations are also prevented. The Great Bear Forest Carbon project is unique in that it is the only Improved Forest Management project of its scale that has equal involvement with the First Nations and the BC Government, strong legal and policy foundations, and robust data to support the quantification of ecosystem services. This is not simply a conservation project; it is a model for sustainable development in an economically valuable but ecologically and culturally vulnerable area.","North and Central-Mid Coast, South Central Coast & Haida Gwaii.

Each project has a buffer pool established and sets aside 10% of verified volume every year. Projects undergo a project specific risk assessment to determine the amount of buffer required.

The FCOP is compliant with the Verified Carbon Standard, so credits created under this protocol are recognized internationally. Although the FCOP is not an ICROA-certified standard, it meets all the requirements of ICROA as detailed below.   Offsets created under the FCOP are independently verified by third party auditors to ensure that they are real, measurable, additional, permanent and unique.

These auditors are accredited to the ANSI certification (the forest category) and ISO 14065:2013 (Greenhouse gases—requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies). All emissions reductions and removals were quantified using recognized measurement tools against a credible emissions baseline, and were validated and verified by independent experts to have genuinely taken place. The FCOP requires projects to be additional by leading to reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise not have taken place. Generated offsets are also required to be in place for 100 years after creation, leading to permanent emission reductions and removals. Lastly, each offset is unique as they receive a serial number that is issued and registered on the BC Carbon Registry (managed by Markit), and are retired after purchase.

"Stockholm Exergi AB","Partnership for subsea storage will be entered. Planned partner is the Northern Lights consortium","800 ktonnes/y BECCS from existing bio-CHP running on forest residues","Bio CCS Stockholm Vartan","Under construction",,"In 2016, Stockholm Exergi commissioned Europe's largest bio CHP (combined heat and power plant), KVV8, where residues from forestry and sawmills are converted into district heating and electricity. The carbon, that is oxidized, comes via photosynthesis from the atmosphere. By separating the biogenic carbon dioxide and permanently store it in the geosphere, the carbon flow is reversed and a carbon sink is formed. The trees will continue to grow - now with CO2 from fossil emissions thus becoming a natural ""CO2 vacuum cleaner"".  At the same time as KVV8 was commissioned, the potential for BECCS, up to 800000 metric ton/y based of the already existing biomass outtake, was identified. A large number of technologies and suppliers have been screened. In 2018 the technology decision was made: the well known Hot potassium carbonates (at the highest Technology Readiness Level (9 av 9)).  The process is very environmentally friendly. However, it requires pressure and temperature. Most of the used energy in the carbon capture process will be recycled in Stockholm's district heating network, which makes the energy penalty very low.  The capture rate is planned at 90 %.   The washed-out carbon dioxide will be purified (from oxygen) and liquefied, before being transported to permanent storage in the North Atlantic. Stockholm Exergi has signed a MoU with the consortium Northern Lights (Eqionor, Total, Shell), for development of a sub-sea storage facility outside the coast of Norway. The storage durability is estimated to more than 10 000 years.   The CC-technology Hot potassium carbonates has been installed worldwide since the 1950s. With purpose to optimize the technology for the conditions at KVV8 in Stockholm, a research plant was commissioned in December 2019, where Stockholm Exergi, in collaboration with the Swedish Energy Agency and the Royal Institute of Technology, tests operational cases and implements experimentation with e.g. catalysts. This research plant can, if there is interest, already today deliver a smaller amount Bio-CC for usage, pending the completion of the storage solution.","Capture: Stockholm, Storage: Coast of Norway","N/A","Capture: Sweden, Storage: Norway",800000,100,0,800000,"10/1/2024","As one of seven quality requirements for permanent storage of carbon dioxide, Stockholm Exergi requires for continuous monitoring.

To demonstrate this Mikro-Tek undertook a field demonstration project in Chile, in collaboration with INFOR, the Chilean Forest Research Institute, forestry companies, and private landowners.  The project focused on three tree species of greatest interest, Radiata pine and Eucalyptus used for wood products, and one native species, Quillay (Quillaja saponaria), used for bark extracts and honey production.    In 1999, indigenous species and strains of mycorrhizae were collected from various forestry sites in the arid and semi-arid zones of Chile. These collections were cultured and screened for effectiveness in Mikro-Tek’s biotech laboratory in Canada and the strains identified as having the most beneficial effect on the seedlings were mass-produced using proprietary inoculum production processes. The inoculum was shipped to Chile and applied to the seedlings in the nurseries, and one million seedlings were field planted on six sites to compare the treated and non-treated seedlings. One year after planting, the average increase in growth of inoculated seedlings over the not-inoculated was 41% for Radiata pine, 47% for Eucalyptus, and 119% for Quillay.

Between 2003 and 2013 over 6,000 ha were planted with 21 local landowner partners. In the original project Mikro-Tek financed their portion of the project costs through internal loans and from company revenues. The landowners financed their portion of the silvicultural costs through a loan from the Chilean Ministry of Forestry (CONAF). That government loan program is no longer available due to government policy changes, and we do not foresee it being reinstated in the near future given the current economic situation in Chile.

This study informed the decision to work with the medium and small-scale landowners who were not in the forestry business, and who had suitably degraded agricultural land on which to plant forests. These landowners typically did not have the forestry expertise, or access to advanced forest management technology, to establish carbon sequestration projects on their own. Mikro-Tek worked with these initial 21 landowner partners to design and establish the first afforestation projects on 6,000 ha. and brought these projects through the entire carbon registration process, achieving both a CDM and a VCS registration.  Of the registered 1.4 million tCO2 only 1,000 have been sold to date.      The Chilean government has indicated that there are more than one million hectares of degraded agricultural land in central Chile that could be converted to forest, so as outlined in Question 16, the grouped project could be expanded considerably. However, it will be necessary to develop an innovative carbon financing mechanism to fund the future projects as the previous CONAF loan subsidy program is no longer available.   ",,,,,,,,

The regions where this Project takes place, Cauca and Tolima, were at the heart of an armed conflict area during the war between the Colombian government and the FARC, which claimed over 200,000 lives. This area has been undergoing a major transition since the peace agreement and this Project aims to provide a legal, sustainable and economically viable pathway for farmers in the region.     Colombia is the world’s third largest coffee producer and 95% of Colombian coffee-growing families operate on small plots of land, averaging five acres each. The Tropical Andes are one of the main coffee-growing areas in Columbia and a major biodiversity hotspot, hosting 25% of the country's flora and representing the richest ecoregion for birds in the country (974 bird species). However, Colombia’s Andean watersheds are threatened by uncontrolled deforestation due to rapid expansion of agriculture and cattle grazing, which degrades the coffee farming conditions and yields due to low pollination, high erosion, frequent pests/diseases, and low water resources. The lack of natural protection makes the farms highly vulnerable to extreme climatic events such as prolonged droughts, heavy rains, storms and landslides. Moreover, coffee farmers often depend on a single source of income and are vulnerable to market fluctuations: price volatility, demand variation, increased costs for inputs such as fertilizers. This Project aims to build farmer resilience through ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation and income diversification.     Since 2014, PUR Projet has worked with 994 farmers in the region to restore 578 hectares and plant 2.3 million trees. Overall, this Project aims to increase the average income of a farmer by 1000 USD/year.  To engage in the project, farmers must have clear land-use rights with no land tenure conflict. PUR Projet is the Project implementor and the Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia is a key partner to support farmer engagement.    Microsoft’s payments for CDRs will support the ongoing growth and scaling of this project to positively impact more farmers through tree planting, education and supporting market-linkages for agroforestry products. Payments will also support farmer incentives to care for the trees, long-term monitoring, and carbon verification. Moreover, there is an opportunity for Microsoft’s payments to support regenerative agricultural practice to provide more CDRs.

It is widely recognised that, for coffee production, agroforestry brings significant benefits in terms of sustainability. In particular, through the carbon stored in the trees, agroforestry promotes a “low carbon” growth for the coffee sector, which is significant in Colombia’s economy. Furthermore, the project is designed at landscape level, and plots are reforested in and around the coffee production area, on degraded land, with a mindset of ecosystem regeneration. This leverages the protection of the natural capital in the coffee regions, and regenerates key ecosystem services for the protection against natural disasters: stabilisation of the soils to prevent landscapes, enhanced water penetration to prevent floods, natural barriers against pest invasion and beyond.     This Project also supports the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG 1 (End Poverty), SDG 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 15 (Life on Land)    The project aims to develop and support Organic coffee production in the South of Colombia, leveraging the knowledge and heritage of indigenous farmers who have managed Organic coffee plots for decades.    ","This project works directly with smallholder farmers, many who are indigenous, who face the challenges of degrading growing conditions, coffee price fluctuations and high input costs. This Project aims to increase annual income per farm due to a reduction in input costs (thanks to nutrient cycling from agroforestry), yield increases due to agroforestry and tree plantations, income and food security from fruit trees and crops, and timber sales. This project also aims to address the impact of climate change through erosion control, hydrological cycle stability and microclimate provision within coffee plots and on a landscape level.   The whole project’s strategy is to empower the farmers’ organisations to manage the  reforestation components and the related consolidation activities over time (in particular timber and other co-products value chains, plantations registration and possible certifications, etc.).

Latin America is the world’s most biodiverse region and largest food exporter but is experiencing a critical tension between agricultural production and the conservation of nature. The conventional agricultural practices are degrading soils and biodiversity, contaminating and depleting water sources, and increasing CO2 emissions. TNC has developed a Regenerative Ranching and Agriculture (R2A) strategy focused on reducing habitat conversion, reversing soil degradation, sequestering carbon, and promoting the adoption of resilient, more productive farming systems. As part of this regional strategy, the Colombian Sustainable Cattle Ranching initiative has been implemented.    The initiative was born from an alliance between the association of cattle farmers in Colombia, the Center for Research in Sustainable Agricultural Systems, Fondo Acción and The Nature Conservancy and since 2010 promotes the improvement of cattle ranching practices in Colombia through the adoption of silvopastoral systems (incorporate trees to the pastures)  that contribute to the reduction of GHG  emissions, the  conservation  of  biodiversity and the  increase of productivity. The Colombian SCR project focused on promoting activities on conservation of forests, and the implementation of silvopastoril systems: i) scattered trees in pastures, ii) live fences and iii) intensive silvopastoral systems.    The project worked in five regions of the country and the land ownership was within its entry requirements so 90% of the participants were owners as such and the rest corresponded to other forms of ownership valid as tenants or possessors in good faith.    To deliver the carbon credits, it is necessary to structure and register of a project for the regions with major potential and the development of a Carbon pilot project in the Orinocense foothills  where will renew the conservation agreements with about 500 producers in  this region, achieving future maintenance of these established areas and the continuing  conservation of forests, additionally, we will be creating strategies to promote new implementations with around 200 (stimate) new producers.    Currently the Conservancy does not have commitments from landowners or parties it identifies in this proposal. The Conservancy would need to secure such commitments before it can make a binding commitment or execute a legal agreement. For this proposal in response to the RFP, the Conservancy must secure all of its internal management approvals before it can make a binding commitment or execute a legal agreement.","Villavicencio","Meta","Colombia",500000,75,0,500000,"6/30/2022","Estimates made for 2030 correspond to a scenario under which conservation agreements would remain with farm owners until 2030.

In the experience of the SCR there are cases of death of owners or sale of the properties, which is beyond the control of the project.

This livestock can be associated with deforestation processes, but this is minimized with the signing of conservation agreements (Zero Deforestation) and their monitoring; additionally, the fact that cattle have a better diet among other foliage of shrubs of silvopastoral systems, emits less enteric methane to the environment and therefore emissions of this gas are mitigated and impacts are reduced.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","The implementation of sustainable livestock practices is promoted at the farm level through the provision of technical assistance and capacity building to develop diversified silvopastoral systems, and includes the development of property management plans to optimize land use and plantation of arboreal and shrub species of high nutritional value to improve livestock production rates; the use of live fences to establish rotation systems that improve grazing efficiency and the establishment of mixed forage banks that improve animal nutrition and food availability throughout the year. All of this leads to a higher bearing capacity of the soil, more dairy or meat production withhigher quality, and a better resistance to the weather changes.    Through the establishment of silvopastoral systems and conservation of natural ecosystems in livestock farms, a great amount of environmental services are generated. For example, any silvopastoral arrangement increases the presence of birds, beetles, bats and flora because it generates suitable habitats for their existence and allows the productive systems to be stepping stones for fauna among fragments of forest; contributing to pollination, seed dispersal, pest control, aeration and improvement in soil fertility and recovering important species of flora.    The SCR initiative also has the potential to address various SDGs:    •	SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth): Sustainable productive systems improve the practices and income of cattle ranchers, anchoring them in formality and sustaining economic growth;  •	SDG 2 (Zero Hunger): Sustainable productive systems increase food quality, quantity and availability, and resilience and livelihoods in the family  •	SDG 13 (Climate Action): The implementation of silvopastoral systems and its associated conservation of natural ecosystems are direct actions to mitigate climate change;   •	SDG15 (Life on Land): Sustainable productive practices contribute to the fight against land degradation and promote the conservation of biodiversity  •	SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production): The efficient management of natural resources will be promoted throughout the supply chains; and   •	SDG 17 (Partnerships): Public and private sector come together to impact the ranchers    For quantification of these benefits, a monitoring plan will be implemented with a battery of indicators focused on sustainability. ","Cattle ranchers and farmers face increased climate variability such as drastic changes in rain and drought patterns. Silvopastoral systems provide a protective effect for the soil and livestock, increasing the adaptation capacity of cattle ranching systems to adverse weather conditions.    The SCR project works with small and medium-sized farmers who have achieved an increase in quality and production per hectare (productivity), greater resilience to climate change (production-income stability) and better margins (reduction of costs of inputs produced locally such as fertilizers, fences, pests, etc.).    We plan to work with associations of producers and carry out capacity development for public organizations and institutions since the area has low technical capacity and low level of knowledge.    In the same way, we will seek the active participation of women in capacity development processes given the important role of women on the farm and we will seek to contribute to the visibility of their work.",,,,,,,,

Costa Rica adopted an ambitious carbon neutrality goal under its NDC and its Decarbonization Plan 2050, showing the country’s strong commitment to the global goal to mitigate climate change. This target relies on the country’s ability to maintain and further expand its PES Program. The country is currently seeking international partners to finance its results and contribute to this ambitious goal. The objective is to raise funds from a variety of sources, both market and non-market based, aligned with and supportive of the San Jose Principles for High Ambition and Environmental Integrity in International Carbon Markets. The proceeds from the sale of CDR to Microsoft will be reinvested in improving and expanding the PES Program, in particular its CDR modalities.

","San José","All provinces of the Costa Rican national territory","Costa Rica",3519304,43.5,3519304,0,"1/1/2014","Costa Rica is one of the few countries in the world that has demonstrated that is possible to decouple deforestation from development, and the significant recovery of forest cover over the past decades is attributed to a combination of command and control measures and positive incentives including the PES Program. It is important to note that the Forestry Law under which the PES Program was established prohibits the cutting or use of forests in national parks, biological reserves, mangroves, protected areas, wildlife refuges and forest reserves owned by the State (Art. 1) and Art. 19 establishes a total prohibition to change the use of forest land: ""On forest-covered land, it will not be allowed to change the use of the land, nor establish forest plantations."" This provides a strong legal foundation  for the reduced  risk of reversals in Costa Rica. The long-term effectiveness of Costa Rica’s policies and frameworks to reduce risk of reversals is demonstrated in the measured and reported deforestation area and GHG emission estimates submitted to the UNFCCC. To illustrate, when comparing the results years for this proposal, 2016-17, as well as 2018 against earlier results years 2014-15, the average annual deforestation rate (ha/year) continues to be reduced overtime, evidence for a low risk of reversals in Costa Rica.    Under the PES contracts, the release of economic incentives is tied to regular monitoring and mandatory periodic reporting. Moreover, the contracts restrict certain types of resource uses, with the aim of avoiding reversals, mainstreaming long-term environmental sustainability into the PES Program, continuing to foster good governance at the national and local levels (including traditional governance structures of indigenous peoples). The PES Program strengthens environmental management and protection by working with the beneficiaries as partners.     The primary focus of the PES Program is conservation, reforestation, and sustainable forest management benefiting small and medium holders. The initial monitoring and reporting tended to focus predominantly on ensuring contract compliance and no alterations of the land uses in areas of conservation, reforestation or sustainable forest management (i.e. that land cover remained untouched). In addition, two of the PES traditional modalities (forest management contracts and reforestation contracts) imply that landowners must commit to maintain forest areas for 15 to 20 years after the contracts ends. These measures evidence that the PES Program includes  measures that reduce the risk of reversals.     It is also important to note that the literature also suggests that areas which are committed long-term to the program store a significantly larger amount of carbon as compared to unenrolled areas. Sierra and Russman (2006) found that agricultural land use declined the longer payments were in effect, disappearing almost entirely by the fifth year. In a review of several sub-national studies of the PES Program, Daniels et al. (2010) highlights this study among others as evidence for a long-term effect on forest expansion relative to a business-as-usual scenario. This highlights the importance of Costa Rica’s long-term commitment to funding its national PES Program over the past 25 years.     Since 2011, Costa Rica has strengthened its coordination mechanism to monitor forest cover (see Figure 2) by improving methodologies for the estimation of activity data, achieving more robust information for decision-making processes. As part of this work, the early warning system for forest fires has been strengthened, allowing quicker responses when these cases are presented. MINAE, through the National Meteorological Institute (IMN) and FONAFIFO, produces forest monitoring data covering the entirety of its national territory every two years. This information will be made available through its national forest monitoring system (https://redd.unfccc.int/uploads/4863_2_sistema_nacional_monitoreo_forestal_costa_rica.pdf) and can be communicated to Microsoft frequently.     Figure 2. Institutional arrangements to ensure the operation of National Forest Monitoring System of Costa Rica.     Source: Costa Rica REDD+ Technical Annex    In addition, Costa Rica will continue to submit its technical information related to REDD+ to the UNFCCC through reference level and REDD+ technical annex submissions, which will benefit from ongoing technical assessment and analysis. Third party verification will be done following VERRA/JNR Framework/VCS Standard requirements.    Costa Rica will also establish  a national ""reversal buffer"" estimated at 9% of the total ""transferable ER for market transaction”. An additional 2% will be added for leakage risks. This 11% of the total ""transferable ER for market transaction” buffer will be used to compensate for any reversals that may occur. This reversal percentage is informed by a reversal risk assessment which Costa Rica carried out by applying the JNR Non-permanence Risk Tool.    It is also important to note that the resources received from Microsoft will be reinvested in supporting the expansion of carbon removals activities as part of the PES Program.    ","Yes","Yes, the project will be certified by June 2021",,,,"Verra (VCS)",,,,,,"Addressing potential adverse environmental risks  The potential environmental risks associated with any forest projects that enhance forest carbon stocks are 1) displacement of emissions/ leakage to other areas; 2) reversals from the results achieved in previous years; and 3) the potential conversion of natural to planted forests.    1)	The PES Program manages risks associated with displacement and leakage by having a national Forest Reference Emission Level and national forest monitoring system in place that enables Costa Rica to monitor possible displacement of emissions from deforestation within the national forest area and to focus on ensuring that REDD-plus results can be measured, reported and verified at the national scale. An integrated package of policies and measures in the National REDD+ Strategy to address the drivers of deforestation on a national scale, reduces to a minimum the risk of displacement.   2)	The PES Program manages the risks associated with reversals in many ways (see response to Question 23 for more details) including by monitoring all forest emissions at a national level. Costa Rica is also investing considerable resources in the prevention and control of forest fires. Since 2011, Costa Rica has improved its methodologies for the estimation of activity data, achieving more robust information for decision making processes. As part of this work, the early warning system for forest fires has been strengthened, allowing quicker responses when these cases are presented. In fact, during the fire outbreak season in 2019, Costa Rica was the less impacted country in the Latin America region.   3)	When it comes to the potential conversion of natural forests, the risks may come from the PES modalities that involve reforestation or introduction of new species into the contracted land (i.e. Reforestation and Agroforestry Contracts). Exotic species could become invasive and displace native species. They could also promote new pests and diseases. To ensure conservation of natural forests and avoid conversion, reforestation projects target only degraded lands and pastures. FONAFIFO also mitigates this risk by establishing minimum requirements per property and undertaking annual evaluations by Forest Regents to ensure compliance at the property level.     Addressing potential adverse social risks    Amongst the beneficiaries of the PES Program, in particular for the forest protection modality/activity, are indigenous peoples. About 5% of country's total forest area is designated as indigenous people lands and much of these IP lands are included in the PES Program. In these territories, potential adverse impacts from the implementation of the PES Program have been identified as part of a safeguards assessment for Costa Rica’s proposal to the GCF to receive REDD+ results-based payment for years 2014 and 2015.    Participation in the PES Program is voluntary and a private decision of the landowner hence the risk of involuntary resettlement due to any government land acquisition is low. However, lands enrolled into the PES by their owners or legitimate claimants could be occupied by informal occupants who, having no recourse for formal claim, would be compelled to leave the land. These could happen both in indigenous and non-indigenous lands.    There is a risk that the PES Program may fail to respect the collective rights of the indigenous people in the development, utilization and control of their territories. There is also a risk that due to their socio-cultural, legal or economic circumstances, indigenous people may not be able to equitably access the benefits provided by the PES Program. These risks will be managed through safeguards measures to be implemented as part of  the GCF project.    An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) that aims to address these potential adverse social and environmental impacts has been included as part of Costa Rica's GCF Proposal. The measures under consideration to address the issues raised above include: 1) prioritizing PES in indigenous peoples’ territories with the lowest percentage of informal occupation; 2) incorporating new procedures to validate the voluntariness and support for PES Program activities in indigenous peoples’ territories by indigenous peoples (including related to representation, governance structures and PES contracts).  ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","The PES Program implementation, and therefore this project, has the potential to deliver multiple social and environmental benefits beyond climate change mitigation.     FONAFIFO, with support from the UN-REDD Programme, carried out in 2017 a series of spatial analyses evaluating the provision of multiple benefits in four REDD+ options to support decision-making:  •	The promotion of low-carbon production systems.  •	Strengthening of forest fire prevention and control programs.  •	The introduction of incentives to strengthen conservation and sustainable forest management.  •	The development of a forest landscape and ecosystem restoration program.    The benefits analyzed where those prioritized in: (1) the Forestry Law (Law N. 7575, 1996), (2) the Law on Use, Management and Conservation of Soils (Law N. 7779, 1998) and (3) pre-consultation processes that were carried out in preparation for REDD+. These benefits are listed below:   •	Mitigation of greenhouse gases.  •	Natural scenic beauty for tourist purposes.  •	Conservation of biodiversity.  •	Support for communities vulnerable to water stress.  •	Potential for socioeconomic improvement.  •	Control of soil loss due to water erosion.  •	Potential for improved governance.    Some of the findings of this analysis show that: (i) agroforestry practices as part of these productive systems strengthen the provision of multiple benefits in agricultural areas across Costa Rica; (ii) the importance of strengthening programs for the prevention and control of forest fires in order to secure the provision of multiple benefits; (iii) incentives to strengthen the conservation and sustainable forest management are relevant for maintaining the provision of forest-derived benefits across Costa Rica; (iv) the restoration of secondary forests enhances the provision of benefits.     Additionally, Costa Rica has recently finished its Benefit Sharing Plan that establishes non-monetary benefits resulting from the emission reductions/removals resulting from the activities under the REDD+ strategy. Non-monetary benefits are defined as goods, services that provide a direct incentive to beneficiaries and can be monitored in an objective manner (e.g., technical assistance, capacity building, and in-kind inputs or investments such as seedlings, equipment, buildings, etc.). For more detailed information see the Benefit Sharing Plan through link on file.     It is also relevant to mention the social and environmental benefits derived from implementing the PES Program in indigenous territories and local communities. One of the most recognized co-benefit is related to the proven organizational capacity and active participation in the implementation of policies. These social and environmental benefits are monitored under the Safeguards Information System (http://ceniga.go.cr/sis/), together with the all REDD+ Cancun safeguards.     Also, there are several research studies focusing on co-benefits of the Costa Rica PES Program. A recent academic study (Havinga I. et al, 2020) spatially quantified three environmental services recognized by Costa Rica’s PES Program: carbon storage, soil erosion control and habitat suitability for biodiversity as a cultural environmental service. The study used the machine learning algorithm random forest to model carbon storage, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to model soil erosion control and Maxent to model habitat suitability. The additional effect of the PES Program on carbon storage was examined using linear regression. Forested land was found to store 235.3 Mt of carbon, control for 148 Mt yr?1 of soil erosion and contain 762,891 ha of suitable habitat for three iconic but threatened species. PES areas enrolled in the program in both 2011 and 2013 were found to store an additional 9 tonC ha?1 on average.    FONAFIFO has sought to maximize their poverty impact by adding particularly disadvantaged districts to the priority areas for the PES Program. As reflected in Table 5 (Payment for Environmental Services application scorecard), forest in properties located in districts where the social development index is below 43.4%, according to MIDEPLAN’s determination in 2013, are awarded with 10 additional points.     Finally, the implementation of the PES Program contributes to various Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) beyond the obvious contribution to SDG 13 Climate Action.     -	SDG 1. No Poverty. By supporting PES in small and medium producers, the program makes an important contribution to the reduction of poverty that has been exacerbated under the COVID19 context. The PES is a cash transfer program of the Costa Rican government that in the context of the COVID-19 recovery phase offers (1) a rapid and cost-effective way to provide basic needs like food and shelter; (2) a means to recover and rebuild after the crisis; and (3) protection from future shocks.    -	SDG 5. Gender equality: The project will make a significant contribution to achieving gender equality by adopting a series of measures which include direct cash transfers to women through the PES,  capacity building, and engaging women in decision making processes in a more robust manner.     -	SDG 15. Life on Earth: By supporting the national payment for ecosystem services scheme, the project contributes to the protection, restoration, and promotion of the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, and to the sustainable management of forests.  ","The project empowers and strongly engages women, who have historically faced systemic barriers to accessing carbon finance in Costa Rica, as in many other countries.     The Government of Costa Rica has recently launched the ‘More Women, more Nature Program’ under the leadership of the Vice-President of Costa Rica with support from UNDP. FONAFIFO is one of the public institutions actively participating in this national initiative supporting women to access finance through the PES Program. FONAFIFO has been strengthening the participation of women within the PES Program, investing 7.3% of the total resources allocated to PES in lands owned or co-co-owned by women in 2019.     In addition, in 2020, a change has been made to the prioritization criteria that FONAFIFO uses to select PES beneficiaries, rewarding 25 additional points to PES applications submitted by a woman as landowner and/or co-owner. This is a very significant measure that is expected to increase the participation of women in the national PES Program in the coming years.    Also, the FONAFIFO Credit Program has a variety of credits lines that range from productive development, to working capital and equipment, to innovative projects. This credit program consists of fiduciary guarantees (up to USD 8,500) or mortgages, and 10-year terms with a fixed 4% interest rate. Since the launch of the Credit Program on May 2020, 5 projects have been placed in the hands of women for a total amount of USD 47,500, in activities mainly focused on the establishment of silvopastoral systems and improvement of ecotourism project.    The project addresses the disproportionate impacts of climate change on low-income and vulnerable communities in Costa Rica. PES can be an important mechanism to transfer needed cash resources directly to impoverished groups to support the COVID-19 recovery phase. In the context of the COVID-19 recovery phase, cash transfers offer three important forms of relief: (1) a rapid and cost-effective way to provide basic needs like food and shelter; (2) a means to recover and rebuild after the crisis; and (3) protection from future shocks. Cash transfers accomplish all of this while giving individuals the autonomy to manage their own expenses and stimulating local economies.     In addition to being widely used to cushion the economic damage from sudden shocks like this pandemic, cash transfers have long been an effective tool for poverty reduction. For decades, studies have consistently found that cash transfers improve development outcomes around the world, including in health, education, employment and overall well-being.     Payment for ecosystem services are unique among cash transfer programs. One key requirement for PES is that payments must be conditional upon performance—that is, participants achieving certain outcomes or doing (or refraining from) certain activities. In the COVID-19 recovery phase, the PES is a readily available tool to achieve desired environmental and social/ economic outcomes.    Since 1997, the Indigenous Territories in Costa Rica have voluntarily participated in the PES Program receiving sources of income for their local economy both for the development of communal and individual activities. To date, 284 contracts have been established between FONAFIFO and indigenous peoples under the different PES modalities, mainly for forest protection. In most cases these contracts have been established with the support of the Indigenous Integral Development Associations (ADI), that serve as a bridge between FONAFIFO and IPs representatives facilitating the process at the local level to reach the PES agreements. Even though indigenous territories have been part of the PES program since its creation, in 2015 new specific criteria were included under the scorecard to strengthen and favor their participation. PES Program procedures includes specific actions to address the particularities of indigenous peoples’ territories (e.g. non-indigenous territories PES have a maximum of 300 hectares per year allowed under the contract, and indigenous PES a maximum of 1000 hectares). These areas will be further supported with resources to be received by FONAFIFO from the GCF for REDD+ results-based payments, with the specific safeguards measures in place to avoid any potential unintended harm.     FONAFIFO works through local organizations to ensure that small producers in remote areas can also participate in the PES Program. The registration under the PES has a fixed cost, which could undermine access of small landowners with fewer hectares of forest and limited financial resources. However, FONAFIFO has promoted collaboration with local organizations that reach out to small producers to support them and facilitate the registration process under the PES Program. These organizations have a Forest Regent hired and several field technicians who undertake the registration process of properties charging different percentage costs adjusted in relation to the size of forest. Thus, the small owner pays a smaller percentage cost, making access to the PES more democratic.    Recently, FONAFIFO has launched a modality of PES for small producers, being the first PES system worldwide to engage this group of stakeholders. Through this modality, small producers can access finance of up to USD 8,500 per year. Cantons with the lowest Human Development Index have been the first beneficiaries in the pilot phase. The primary objective of this new modality of PES is to increase the number of small producers involved in the rehabilitation of agroforestry landscapes.    Also, FONAFIFO has sought to maximize their poverty impact by adding particularly disadvantaged districts to the priority areas for the PES Program. As reflected in Table 5 (PES Program scorecard), forest in properties located in districts where the social development index is below 43.4%, according to MIDEPLAN’s determination in 2013, are awarded with 10 additional points.

Rural communities depend heavily on forest resources for their livelihoods, supplementing their diets by hunting and collecting non-timber forest products. Farmers frequently practice shifting agriculture due to poor fertility, and agricultural production is generally low. Over the last 10 years, the rate of deforestation in the landscape has been approximately 0.53% per year    Since 2005, WWF has been working in the 12M hectare province of Mai Ndombe. In 2015, we launched a pilot project to structure Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to rural communities to support reforestation and savannah protection efforts through a REDD+ benefit-sharing scheme (see attachment).  The project is consistent with the strategies of the provincial REDD+ program recently approved by the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility’s (FCPF) Carbon Fund and has significant potential for scaling. We are planning to extend the current program to include an additional 10,000 hectares (restoration of degraded forest) and 20,000 hectares (protection of savannah), leading to both removals and reduced deforestation and degradation in these ecosystems.    Rural residents in DRC earn an average daily income of $1.25 USD, experience lack of access to health care and education, and depend on the uncertain returns of shifting agriculture. Facing such difficult economic circumstances, community members sometimes turn to illegal logging or poaching wildlife to supplement their incomes and provide for their families.  The PES scheme provides a dependable stream of income to rural communities with co-benefits such as improved access to health care and education.     The pilot PES program has proven to be an effective means of restoring forests and protecting savannah from burning, thereby reducing carbon emissions and increasing storage. WWF will also continue its engagement with National Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development to advance the jurisdictional REDD+ program in Mai Ndombe and look for opportunities to strengthen DRC’s Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Climate Accord.

Please refer to Organizational Survey",,"When deforestation and degradation occur in the Mai Ndombe landscape, rural communities are negatively impacted, as forests are a source of food (supplementing diets that depend largely on subsistence agriculture) and non-timber forest products. The areas planned for reforestation and protection are under tenure to local communities who are responsible for land use planning decisions. WWF supports these communities in land management planning in order to ensure that the species planted, eventual forest use and restoration are ecologically sound. For these reasons, there are multiple benefits and very limited foreseeable negative impacts.  With expansion of the pilot project to new communities, we will raise awareness of the benefits of restoring forest ecosystems and inform these communities and their decision makers about how they can access and benefit from PES. Also, women and Indigenous Peoples in these communities often face barriers to participation in governance and important livelihood activities. WWF’s approach promotes the inclusion of women and IPs in governance committees and in literacy and savings group activities that enable disempowered individuals to fully engage in community management and decision-making, and to benefit from economic opportunities such as establishing tree nurseries.  Reforestation of previously deforested areas will be through planting native and endemic species to ensure habitat integrity is maintained or expanded, while afforestation of savannah will be to rapidly growing species such as acacia to provide fuelwood in the near-term, removing pressure on nearby forests. Carbon calculations will account for harvesting of mature fuelwood. The availability of fuelwood from continuously renewed plantations will reduce degradation in standing native forests and will provide an additional source of income for communities.  More broadly, WWF is globally committed to robust social and environmental safeguards.  The board of WWF International and the WWF Network Executive Team (NET) agreed to adopt an updated social and environmental safeguards framework in June 2019 and to ensure consistent, comprehensive application of safeguards across the entire WWF Network . The framework is publicly available and will be reviewed and updated periodically in consultation with stakeholders across the WWF Network and with outside practitioners and civil society organizations (CSOs). ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","Not applicable","Not applicable","Yes","Co-benefits of this initiative are primarily related to social sustainability through the provision of supplementary income to communities, including to provide services which are currently unavailable. As in many other countries with an increasing rate of population growth, rural residents are migrating to large cities in search of employment. Exhausted farmland is declining in productivity, fish stocks in rivers are endangered, and there is increased dependence on bushmeat for protein. For the last three decades, as economic activity in the larger Mai Ndombe landscape has shrunk, access to health care and education has also disappeared. By engaging in reforestation and restoration activities that are eligible for Payments for Ecosystem services, the communities will have the financial resources to invest in social infrastructure and services including clean drinking water, schools and health clinics.  This initiative is closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals of Poverty Reduction and Decent Work and Economic Growth through increasing local employment opportunities in both forest management and support to establish forest resource-based SMEs; Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities by inclusion of women, IPs and marginalized community members in governance and economic opportunities; Life on Land by expanding forest cover by 10,000 hectares, and establishing fuelwood plantations that will replace wood supply from standing native forests, thereby reducing damage to those forests and wildlife habitat. Also, the production of seedlings for reforestation and plantations will provide a source of income and will reduce the local population’s dependence on hunting for subsistence. The project will also contribute to the SDGs of Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well-being, Quality Education and Clean Water and Sanitation by rebuilding local economies, thereby enabling rural communities to provide these social services, and individuals to provide for their families.","Given the technical complexity of engaging in the carbon finance economy, rural communities in DRC must be supported to access this sector. WWF, in partnership with the DRC Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, and supported by the World Bank, has been working through the pilot REDD+ project in the Mai Ndombe landscape to enable PES benefits to these communities that reforest and protect their land. At the same time, WWF builds capacity of community members to strengthen their ability to form governance structures and to make decisions on land use and development of social infrastructure.  The benefits from PES will raise the standard of living of rural populations that are highly dependent on forests and will reduce the possibility of over-exploitation of natural resources. The existing pilot project is working with more than 168 communities to produce 13,301,716 tree seedlings and reforest 10,221 ha hectares of native species and 13,271 ha hectares intended as fuelwood plantations to offset harvest from natural standing forests. Community members will be responsible to manage these forests sustainably, with technical support and capacity building provided by the partnership.   Rural residents in DRC are among the poorest people in the world, with extremely limited access to basic social services. However, they are on the front line of potentially devastating threats to the ecosystems on which they depend.  Programs that mobilize carbon finance enable these communities to raise their standard of living and motivate individual community members to engage in reforestation and environmentally beneficial activities through PES. Actions taken to reforest degraded areas and establish fuelwood plantations in abandoned savannahs will reduce the rate of illegal logging, and unsustainable extraction, while providing calculable emissions reductions that contribute to DRC’s Nationally Determined Contributions.",,,,,,,,

We do not want to submit individual projects within our portfolio as we believe that there is merit for Microsoft to view them in a portfolio context and 12Tree as a long-term partner. The proposal focuses on four core projects - Hacienda Ambrosia, La Paz, Hacienda Maquencal and Finca Chimelb. Each of them is unique, but for purpose of explaining our projects and objectives we use Hacienda Ambrosia (first to receive certification):    Ambrosía is an organic cocoa farm growing in the shade of coconut palms. It is situated in a remote part in the north of the Dominican Republic at the end of a valley and nestled into the mountains. The nearest town large town is Nagua. The overall project size is 2,132 ha of which roughly half is natural forest conservation area, situated next to a research reserve. The palm plantation was established in the early 1990 by a local conglomerate extraction of coconut oil for soap production. However, it quickly fell into disuse and degraded. Since early 2019 our local subsidiary 12Tree Organics S.A.S. has been restoring the existing coconut palm fields and is planting new coconut crops and a 800 ha fine flavor cocoa area as well as plantain and establishes honey production. The farm will have 60 million bees! It already achieved organic certification and built an entirely gravity-fed irrigation system, the first of its kind in the DR. Coconut/Cocoa agroforestry systems have a very high carbon storage potential above and in the soil. In addition a large area of natural forest is under our protection. We commenced with the construction of the processing units for a range of premium handcrafted coconut products - water, oil and sugar - creating hundreds of jobs specifically for single mothers, who otherwise have no opportunity to enter the formal employment market - due to the lack of childcare support systems. This is an extensive social problem in the Dominican Republic. For these aspects we leverage the social work track record of our joint venture partner Clarke's Organics (www.misolococo.com/).    For more project details we also refer to the project description in our uploaded Sustainability Report.

First, the farm’s use of resources is measured to reduce or boost certain impacts – not only on the farm’s territory but in the wider community. The collection of farm data focuses on aspects such as social and human capital, land use history, soil characteristics, soil conservation practices, irrigation system, use of fertilizer, compost, biodiversity, etc.    Second, for each of the key environmental and social issues relevant at farm level, metrics are collected on a yearly basis. The metrics reflect our actions regarding the protection and the improvement of habitats for biodiversity, the soil quality monitoring, the livelihood, the water quality (and quantity) use and quantity, as well as our waste management. These indicators allow us to track the performance of each farm and to compare between farms in the same region (or country) and over the years.    Third, social measures implemented by the company are adapted to the specific human and local contexts. This step is about building practices that will help us foster more inclusive economic development and to improve livelihoods, while, at the same time, to protect natural resources and the physical and human environment of the region. This does not only concern the 12Tree plantations and workforce, but also of benefit to the wider region and community. We are currently setting-up small farmers projects in Guatemala, Ecuador and Colombia close to our main farms. We work with a nucleus-plasma approach, please see our further information in the PDF uploaded.    More than just listing good practices, we consider the synergies of usages based on the principles of the circular economy. This includes for example the re-usage of water, the use of cocoa bean shells for creating a landcover and the recycling of organic waste.    By no means, this indicator framework pretends to replace international certifications such as UTZ, Organic Certification, or Fair For Life. Hacienda Ambrosia is the first farm of our portfolio with the organic certification.","Our investments create businesses that continue to positively impact forest landscapes, the people that live in them, and the global climate, by producing sustainable, deforestation-free crops well beyond the scope and timeframe we initially set out.     We want to reinvest the income from the carbon credits to support impact activities in and around the farms with local partners. Our goal is to establish small farmers projects close to all our farms. We also seek to add value to our crops by supporting processing centers in rural areas: for instance, Ambrosia, our coconut-cocoa project in the Dominican Republic, employs 300 single-mothers in the production of coconut organic oil.     We commissioned Kinomé, an independent third-party consulting company, with the evaluation of the social impacts of our projects. By contrast with traditional social impact analysis, the reflection does not start from  12Tree’s needs, but from local populations’ needs. The idea is then to “bridge” these needs with those of the 12Tree Farms, and then gradually with those of the other stakeholders (local, regional and national institutions, scientists, NGOs…) in order to create a common vision and plan for the future, strengthening in this way the operations, the stability, the scaling potential and the resilience of the company.  One key purpose of the Kinomé audits is therefore to make the social impact part of the operation more transparent to all stakeholders and to constantly suggest concrete measures for improvement, whether the status quo in terms of social impacts is bad, good or excellent.",,,,,,,,

The successful commercial operation of O.C.O Technology is the result of many years of award-winning research. Founded in 2010, the company established its first production facility in 2012 and now operate three sites in the UK; Brandon (Suffolk), Avonmouth (Bristol) and Leeds. Together they process over 120,000 tonnes of waste each year which would have otherwise been sent to landfill and produce over 300,000 tonnes of sustainable, carbon negative aggregate.  O.C.O facilities capture 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum and are constructing more UK facilities to provide additional process capacity, in light of the strong demand for its services.      O.C.O Technology is one of the largest commercial CCU businesses in the world.  The company continues to develop new products and processes and signed its first international deal in 2019, with a novel pilot plant now under construction in Japan.  The patented Accelerated Carbonation Technology (ACT) is a genuine carbon capture and utilization process.  The process uses carbon dioxide gas, which is permanently captured as stable carbonate minerals.  In the UK the business has developed the ACT to treat and stabilize thermal residues and in turn valorize them into a Manufactured LimeStone (M-LS) aggregate. The M-LS production process employs multiple stages to convert waste into aggregate.  O.C.O Technology is one of the few companies in the UK to hold ‘End of Waste’ approval from the Environment Agency for the aggregate output.    Currently in the UK the O.C.O Technology ACT utilizes liquefied carbon dioxide from commercial suppliers, which in turn is sourced from bioethanol production or fertilizer manufacture.  The carbon dioxide would otherwise be discharged to the atmosphere as a by-product of these processes.  The carbon dioxide permanently captured by the ACT process is therefore a genuine contribution to climate change mitigation.    Microsoft's payments for CDR will be invested in the further development of the business, notably the research into novel biological carbon capture technology suitable for either Direct Air Capture technology or carbon recovery from flue gas, as well as the global development and collaborative carbon capture projects.

The O.C.O process chemically bonds the captured carbon dioxide into highly stable and strong carbonate compounds, which can only be disassociated by strong acids. Like naturally occurring carbonates, they are stable over geological timescales. However, the permanence will be affected by the use of the material and its exposure to stresses (e.g. weathering), as would be the case for a natural carbonate. Nevertheless, the sequestration is not considered to be transient during the products lifecycle (minimum 50 years) and is as such permanent.  We therefore consider that even at end of life of the aggregate, the carbon dioxide will remain chemically bonded and will not be released back into the atmosphere. Processing or repurposing of the aggregate e.g. by crushing, will not result in the release of the chemically bonded carbon.","No","No, the project will not be certified by June 2021 (please specify)","Methodology development under one of ICROA approved standards is expected to happen in 2020 / early 2021.

This includes the carbon footprint of the raw materials used in the manufacture of the product, the transport of those materials to the manufacturing site, and the energy used to manufacture the product. Since the primary ingredient to produce the aggregate is waste, this is a carbon neutral feedstock. The carbon dioxide introduced to the process is permanently chemically bound as stable carbonates. The carbon removal is a combination of 'process removal' and 'post - process removal', which takes account of both the CO2 used to treat the waste materials and also the CO2 subsequently captured by the on-going chemical reactions that take place for about a week after production of the aggregate.  The carbon reduction is calculated based on scientific studies undertaken by Dr. Peter Gunning of OCO, including in a peer - reviewed article published in 'Waste Management' in 2010, a copy of which is included as an additional document.  The process itself does not produce any waste as everything delivered to site is converted and sold as a product. No emissions are associated with the process other than fugitive emissions of heat and steam. This arises because the process is exothermic (releases heat) through the reaction of the waste with carbon dioxide. Therefore, the process is highly energy efficient.

The new woodland is under development and connects other areas of existing forest, a vitally important part of the ecosystem’s mosaic and will provide habitat for woodland species in an area of the country with low tree cover. Glades, rides, and other open spaces are very important structural elements within the design of this woodland, providing valuable habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including locally rare Dark-Green and Silver Wash Fritillary butterflies.   The project site is former arable land, which fell out of usage and subsequently turned to poor-quality grass cover, with low levels of biodiversity. With the help of carbon finance, the owner is creating a native woodland on this currently unused land that will improve soil quality, increase biodiversity and be of real value to the village community it borders.   Recreational access for local walkers is being maintained, with a well-used footpath that heads across the site to the riverbank being included in the project’s design.   Due to its close proximity to the river and neighbouring village, this woodland has been designed to deliver improvements in water quality, reduce soil erosion and to mitigate the risk of flooding in the area.   The woodland will be managed as continuous cover, an approach to forest management that seeks to create more diversity, both structurally and in terms of species composition, by avoiding clear felling. It can also potentially produce a small amount of wood products as it develops, supporting diversification of the rural economy.

One of the most important aspects of his work has been the high carbon content and high stability of the carbon. This enables the use of biochar as a carbon sink when deposited so that there is no risk of composting. Sampo’s vision has always been to establish a mechanism that will enable the extracting of carbon from the atmosphere into top soils out of the active carbon circulation.     Carbofex operates a commercial proof-of-concept plant in Tampere, Finland. The plant produces EBC-certified biochar and district heat for the city of Tampere’s new “circular economy district” of Hiedanranta.     The concept is to produce biochar to utilise the excess energy for carbon negative heating to replace peat and natural gas. The biochar is also used as a carbon sink, and it is made sure it can not burn during use and that it doesn’t get incinerated after use. The main applications are horticultural growing substrates for plants and water filtration. After the primary use, the biochar is recycled and used as soil amendment for agriculture and landscaping.    Carbofex is a partner with EBC for the quality of the biochar and  Puro.earth to verify the carbon net-negativity operations and to sell the removals. The verification is done by Det Norske Veritas DNV GL.  ","Tampere",,"Finland",200,100,200,2000,"11/1/2019","We have little uncertainty in the permanence of our project, because our removal is a recarcitrant, mineralized, physical storage material. For the same reason reversals are not expected in our project, because the verifier checks that the biochar is not shipped to combustive use.   The durable storage of biochar and the carbon dioxide embodied in it can be estimated with the O:C ration received from the laboratory test. In general, a molar ratio of O:C lower than 0.2 appears to provide, at minimum, a 1000-year biochar half-life. There is a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010), which allows to calculate a duration over which 90% of carbon in the biochar remains. The O:C ratio measured in our biochar is 0.021.    Puro methodologies always contain a buffer that covers premature reversals of carbon removal. In the biochar methodology the buffer is currently between 2,5 -5% reflecting the scientifically measured quality of the biochar i.e. the O:C ratio.    We only offer removals that already have been performed (ex-post).    We only sell biochar to users in the horticultural and landscaping sector, to make sure it ultimately ends up in arable topsoils. We also use the biochar to provide environmental services (phosphorous, nitrogen removal), and then recycle the loaded biochar into horticulture.

Those emissions are avoided by stabilizing the carbon in the wood into our biochar for hundreds of years.  Harvesting and managing forests sustainably decreases risk of forest fires, insects and diseases. Pre-commercial harvesting is the first step in sustainable forest management.  Replacement of materials and their emissions: Use of Biochar can displace use of fertilizer, water filters or building materials that would have caused emissions.  Yield increase impacts: When biochar is used in substrates or soil improvements for horticulture in greenhouses or agriculture, 10% yield increases have been reported. More crops and products means also that less land is required for producing the same amount of food or that more food can be grown on the existing farm land and greenhouses.

Qvidja spearheads the Carbon Action network of farms that apply carbon negative farming practices. Compensate acquires the CDR credits from the company Virpunen Varainhallinta, which manages the farm. The carbon removal takes place on the Qvidja Farm.    Qvidja, located in Western Finland, is a pilot farm. The farm’s crop and livestock production operates through carbon sequestration and the cycling of nutrients. This innovative farming method binds carbon dioxide to the farmed soil, and in addition, these methods keep harmful substances from cultivating in the nearby Baltic Sea.    Compensate and Qvidja have an agreement that defines Qvidja’s role as a subcontractor and provider of CRD credits in this RFP.     Significant partners also include the Carbon Action network and the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Qvidja and the Finnish Meteorological Institute have agreed that the Institute provides the necessary scientific support to measure the carbon removals.     Carbon Action is a Finnish platform that develops, studies and supports the acceleration of soil carbon sequestration and methods of scientifically verifying its impact. It also promotes climate-friendly, regenerative farming practices to Finnish farms.     The Finnish Meteorological Institute is responsible for the scientific research and development of the carbon sequestration methodology done within Carbon Action projects and on the Qvidja farm.

More specifically, we apply treatments where we decrease management intensity (reducing tilling, chemical NK fertilizer and pesticide use; leaving grass taller and cutting less often), and increase species diversity (include species from different functional groups, at least one species that has deep roots) to i) increase photosynthesis ii) increase microbial activity iii) decrease disturbance in our pilot farm soils. These practices have been found to sequester approximately 100 gC/m2/yr amount of extra carbon in the grassland soils (Heimsch et al., submitted). Our approach is heavily focused on improving the scientific workflow that combines measurement and modeling efforts to quantify the additional carbon sequestration with uncertainties and link it with carbon-smart practices.    This project is associated with a larger network of Finnish Carbon Action farms that is established in 2019 (https://carbonaction.org/en-stn-multa/). Among the 100 Carbon Action farms, Qvidja farm has been intensively studied by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) and chosen for this project as a pilot site. Qvidja has been a cultivated land for several hundred years (www.qvidja.fi) and currently owned by Saara Kankaarinta and Ilkka Herlin. The land currently acts as a pilot farm for carbon sequestration.     Within this setting, FMI is the scientific partner where cutting-edge carbon monitoring and verification frameworks are being developed. Process-based dynamic computer simulators of agricultural systems (models) are at the center of this framework. Unlike static inventory-based approaches, dynamic models allow reliable predictions outside of historical norms which is critical to account for the changing climate. Data play a critical role in the modeling activities as covariates, drivers, initial conditions, as well as to constrain model parameters and states. Indeed, these models provide a way to synthesize a diverse array of data in a sensible manner and rescale knowledge obtained to other spatial and temporal settings. To this end, FMI has been developing the cyberinfrastructure to combine models and data with analytical tools to provide predictions with uncertainty estimates, and inform next data and model needs.

In the case of wooden building elements, the place in the value chain where it makes no economic sense to let the CO2 escape back into the atmosphere is the facility where the logs are cut to measure for a specific building. After this point it would be unwise to use the resulting timber elements for anything else than creating a long term carbon storage.  Finnish Log House Industry Association and its member companies build the log houses in Finland. Log house production is energy self-sufficient, and even more, as it generates more bioenergy as by-product than the energy it takes to manufacture the product. Despite of all of these positive characteristics, wood as building material is marginal and could be used in much larger volumes.  In Europe, buildings are regulated to have a minimum lifetime of 50 years, and in real life the CO2 storage is likely to be longer. By storing CO2 for a minimum of 50 years, wooden building elements present an opportunity for companies to invest in carbon capture and storage, and take proactive steps towards carbon net zero.  The wood used by Log Houses is sustainably harvested according to FSC and/or PEFC principles. The average (145 m2) Finnish log house stores over 30 000 kg of CO2 and locks it into long-term storage that stays out of circulation for 50-100 years.

" Compensate Foundation (Kompensäätiö sr)","The subcontractor and carbon asset developer is Carbonfuture GmbH. Carbonfuture is an innovative carbon sink transaction platform, which provides verifiable end-to-end carbon removal accounting and flexible trading. The permanence of the carbon sinks is 100 years.    Carbonfuture’s blockchain technology enables the tracking of carbon sinks, which prevents the issues of double counting. It also maintains its own registry. Generally, cf-Certificates are based on certificates issued by or certification standards set by independent third parties. Carbonfuture works in close collaboration with the European Biochar Industry Consortium (EBI) and Ithaka Institute.     The EBI represents key players in the European biochar industry: manufacturers of carbonization plants, producers of biochar based products, and end users of biochar. It supports the industry regarding adherence to regulation and norms, such as REACH. EBI focuses on industry advocacy and the verification of the biochar methods and applications.    Carbonfuture quantifies and documents CDRs by C-preserving application of certified biochar and issues the respective credits according to the EBC-Sink standard. Furthermore, carbonfuture has its own registry which will be linked to the EBC registry.     The EBC-sink standard is an amendment of the well-known EBC standard for biochar. The EBC-sink standard allows to quantify the C-sink potential of (EBC- or IBI-) certified biochar at the production site. The EBC-sink standard further requires that processing, transport and the final C-preserving application of the material is taken into account and documented in order to issue the respective CDR credits. All biochar production facilities which are recognized under this project are subject to an annual audit according to both the EBC standards and the EBC-sink standards. This audit is performed by independent and accredited auditors. Carbonfuture GmbH as issuer of the respective credits is subject to independent audits according to the EBC-sink standard. However, the standard is very recent (first published in June 2020) and carbonfuture GmbH is the first entity that issues such credits. The respective audit processes and timelines are not yet defined.     The Ithaka Institute is an international open-source network for carbon strategies and a nonprofit research foundation. The Institute issues EBC certificates, which is the most important certificate for biochar and its production as a material. In June 2020, the Ithaka Institute issued the EBC-Sink standard, which is the basis for the C-sink credits provided by Carbonfuture.","Carbon-preserving biochar applications according to the EBC-sink standard."," Carbonfuture C-sinks","https://carbonfuture.earth ",,"The CDR credits are based on two components:   - EBC-sink certificate quantifying the CDR potential of the biochar at production site  - C-preserving application, documented by the “Carbonfuture Coupon”, signed by the biochar user    All relevant data for end-to-end auditing is stored on the Carbonfuture registry based on IBM Hyperledger. The CDR calculation works as follows:  - Part of EBC-sink: C-neutral feedstock source, deduction of the non-C components of the biochar, deduction of emissions related to feedstock provision, preparation (e.g., drying, chipping), deductions related to emissions of the pyrolysis process (energy, potential methane emissions).  - Performed by Carbonfuture: Deduction of transportation and processing emissions to obtain the C-sink value at inception. Finally, a conservative decay factor for soil applications is applied to generate a “sequestration curve” over 100 years.    The final CDR value is determined as the average amount of tons CO2e sequestered over 100 years.    Biochar producers having the EBC-sink certificate can participate. Currently, Carbonfuture is working with Austrian producer who holds the first EBC-sink certificate, and a German biochar product dealer. Onboarding of further producers, dealers and users in Central Europe, Scandinavia and California, is in preparation. Currently, the C-preserving applications are all soil related. However, usage in materials is in principle eligible.    Carbonfuture acts as principle, buying the CDR credits from users and wholesalers on a single delivery basis (as granular as single big bags of biochar). Carbonfuture uses sustainable biochar feedstock, including industry side streams, waste wood (pest) and wood not fit for material use, thus having low economic value. Each individual delivery represents a separate C-sink, with individual location and sequestrations curve. Carbonfuture bundles these CDRs and sells them to Compensate. Currently, these CDRs allow for a discount for the biochar of 10-20%, with the expectation to realize 20-30% through industrialisation of biochar production and volume growth.     The vision is to foster climate action by massive scaling of biochar use in cascade value chains worldwide, boosted by carbon financing. The current project serves as blueprint.  The initial ideas are from Hans-Peter Schmidt (Ithaka Institute) and Hansjörg Lerchenmüller (EBI). They encouraged the mathematician and finance expert Hannes Junginger (now Carbonfuture CEO) to design a framework for rigorous characterization and flexible financing of C-sinks. The concept and a prototype implementation were presented at the IBI study tour 2019 in Finland and at the annual congress of the German biochar association (Fachverband Pflanzenkohle) resulting in establishment of Carbonfuture.","Freiburg","Baden-Württemberg","Germany",1000,100,1000,10000,"4/13/2020","Permanence is 100 year (a decay factor is included, so that at inception, more than a ton is sequestered in order to ensure 1 ton on average over 100 years).

The EBC certificate (i.e., the certificate for the material itself, not the EBC-sink certificate which quantifies the sink potential) ensures environmental and workplace safety. The feedstock provision and the biochar production itself requires energy (in particular Diesel for transportation and electricity for process operation). The respective emissions are deducted from the sink potential according to the EBC-sink standard, where the differentiation between energy sources (renewable or country mix in case of electricity) is made. In addition, biochar production may cause methane emissions, which is also recognized by the EBC-sink standard.    The EBC-sink certificate explicitly defines eligible biomass feedstock sources. A substantial part of the biochar is produced from woody feedstock which comes from forestry. This requires particular awareness and it is one of the key constraints when onboarding further biochar producers. The EBC certificate requires that the biochar may only be produced from forest wood if sustainable management of the corresponding forest can be proven by PEFC or FSC certificates or by comparable regional standards or laws.

The goal of the company is production of high-quality biochar which offers solutions to the problems of modern agriculture. The product has many benefits; the loss of nutrients and nitrate leaching are reduced, the use of fertilizers is considerably reduced, groundwater is protected, and soil fertility is sustainably improved. The production of one ton of high-quality biochar, results in 2,8 tons of harmful carbon dioxide becoming firmly bound for centuries enabling the responsible farmer to make an important contribution to climate and environmental protection.  The cascade usage of biochar begins with the feeding of ÖKO FEED biochar and the use of ÖKO TERR for the litter. Animal health, animal welfare and the climate are improved, and the biochar is charged with nutrients. The ÖKO TERR biochar can also be loaded with liquid manure and thus becomes a valuable natural fertilizer when it is applied to the soil.    Carbon cycle sells its biochar to the farming industry in several EU countries. The biochar has been approved as a soil additive and as animal feed. Carbon cycle has the European certificate of sustainable produced biochar.    Untreated wood chips from regionally and sustainably managed forests (FSC / PEFC) are used to manufacture the premium biochar.     Each tonne of biochar sequesters 2,8 tonnes of CO2 for over 1000 years. Using the O-molar ratio from the analysis of the product the stability of the carbon content can be accurately measured. Using this methodology, Carbon Cycle biochar has an expected carbon removal duration in excess of 17 000 years.    Carbon cycle started production in 2019 with a highly efficient e-flox design. The plan is to scale up production from 2 to 6 kilns during 2021. The revenue from the sales of CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) is an essential part of the business case for further investment.

The durable storage of biochar and the carbon dioxide embodied in it can be estimated with the O:C ration received from the laboratory test. In general, a molar ratio of O:C lower than 0.2 appears to provide, at minimum, a 1000-year biochar half-life. There is a simple decay model based on Campbell et al.

Acquisition of farmlands and impact on the livelihood of farmers.  Mitigation measures proposed: Miro Forestry has proposed to allow the short-term intercropping of certain crops alongside the planting of tree seedlings by local, legitimate farmers. Affected farmers will have the option of participating in the project activities as farmers in order to improve their livelihoods. This will be under strict conditions for intercropping activities to ensure the control of the use of herbicides by farmers, the choice of crops, the preparation of soil beds to minimize soil erosion, and the run-off into water bodies. Project-affected farmers have been identified and will be considered first by Miro Forestry for the intercropping scheme and/or employment. All farmers will be allowed to harvest their crops before the commencement of work.  2. Impact of agrochemical on soil and contamination of water bodies and aquatic life  Mitigation measures proposed: Miro Forestry will ensure that only agrochemicals approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from licensed agrochemical shops will be purchased and used. All agrochemicals on the FSC list of ‘highly hazardous’ pesticides will be avoided. Miro Forestry will control the application of weedicides and fertilizers by adhering to stipulated limits and recommended dosages, avoiding overspills and over-concentrations. Miro Forestry will preferentially use selective pesticides with a low environmental impact quotient rather than broad-spectrum products; this is to minimize the impacts on non-target species. The application of agrochemicals will follow an integrated pest management approach. The project will ensure that workers and farmers involved in the intercropping scheme are properly trained in the use of and disposal methods for chemicals. Activities will avoid using weedicides in areas close to water bodies and avoid using them on steep slopes near water bodies. They will also limit the application of fertilizer to farmland that may subsequently leach/seep into underground water.  3. Social conflict with the local community, migrant settlers and farmers  Mitigation measures proposed: Community sensitization programs will continue and will include:  •        holding meetings at the community level to further explain the project and its socio-economic benefits to the people;  •        facilitating the formation of a consultative group with selected representatives from the communities to meet periodically with Miro Forestry and plan for peaceful co-existence.

These include establishment costs, seedling costs, land maintenance costs, farmer payments to ensure successful farm renovation and maintenance of forest buffers, community payments to incentivize and reward sustainability and host government payments to support the operating environment for large-scale landscape restoration.    Beyond the direct project outcomes, Microsoft’s CDR payments will be used to catalyze landscape restoration at scale.  The project will develop the foundations to help overcome 4 barriers to landscape restoration at scale:    *Restoration infrastructure;  *Carbon credit systems;  *Impact monitoring technology;  *Finance systems.    These foundations will help catalyze the forest carbon restoration market and support a pipeline of large-scale landscape projects enabling Microsoft to rapidly achieve its CDR targets with a balanced portfolio, including significant investment in robust nature-based solutions.

"Carbon Engineering Ltd.","Carbon Engineering’s business model is to license our technology to plant development partners around the world to enable the fastest possible global deployment of Direct Air Capture solutions. Carbon Engineering has a growing, global network of experienced project developers acting as CE’s plant development partners with whom we have already agreed to plant development arrangements or with whom we are negotiating potential plant development agreements.  These partners will build Direct Air Capture plants that capture atmospheric CO2 for utilization or sequestration, and/or AIR TO FUELS™ plants that reuse atmospheric CO2 to create ultra-low-carbon synthetic fuel.","Global opportunities for affordable, scalable, permanent CDR at climate-relevant volumes.","Multiple International Direct Air Capture and Storage Projects",,,"To mitigate climate change we need worldwide adoption of scalable, affordable technological solutions like Direct Air Capture (DAC). CE’s business model addresses this need through the licensing of its technology to plant developers worldwide. These plant developers will build, own and operate DAC plants, supporting global access to this critical clean infrastructure.     A fundamental advantage of DAC technology is the ability to capture CO2 from any location on the planet and to whatever scale is required. DAC plants are therefore able to be located directly alongside sequestration or utilization sites, minimizing the need for CO2 transport infrastructure. This flexibility allows DAC plants to be fielded in many different locations worldwide, each developed from a standard plant design prepared by CE.    As CE’s set of authorized global plant developers increases, multiple DAC projects will be able to provide high-quality, permanent CDR at climate-relevant scale over the coming decades. Consistent with standard industrial experience, project costs will fall as more plants are built and as CE develops improved and optimized DAC technology.    For this RFP response, CE is describing this growing set of high-quality CDR opportunities. As CE concludes these and additional plant development agreements and works with its plant developers worldwide, each of these development companies will be able to offer large-scale carbon removal to Microsoft and other customers. Our RFP response describes our developing plant developer network, our standard plant design, and the cost reductions we expect to achieve as CE’s technology is widely deployed.    To facilitate plant development, offtake commitments for carbon dioxide removal are essential and we applaud Microsoft’s leadership in solving for both current and legacy emissions!  As a critical early adopter, Microsoft is helping to develop a carbon dioxide removal market through its corporate commitment to achieve net-negative emissions and through its worldwide brand recognition. These offtake commitments can be either negotiated with CE, who can then assign the offtake agreement to a qualified plant developer or, in the future, negotiated with CE’s plant developers directly.  ","Global","Global","Global",6000000,100,0,6000000,"1/1/2025","For negative emissions created by geologic sequestration of captured atmospheric CO2, CE intends that projects will fall under one or more of today’s “best in class” protocols. Projects that sequester carbon dioxide in compliance with this growing set of protocols must go through extensive certification upfront to ensure that the lifecycle impacts of the capture, transportation, injection, and storage steps are well quantified. Further injection and storage facilities must be geologically characterized and a “Maintenance Monitoring, and Verification” Plan must be submitted and approved. Such MMV plans detail instrumentation and monitoring programs capable of detecting leakage and mitigation responses to such events. This means that such projects are expected to have low risks of significant leakage. Similarly, compliance with leading protocols typically stipulates carbon accounting methods to account for any such leakage event, which all involve deducting any volume of leaked CO2 from the total volume of carbon removal generated by the project.","No","No, the project will not be certified by June 2021 (please specify)","CE’s projects fall under governmental and/or ISO requirements, not ICROA.

Plants are powered by renewable energy (e.g., wind, solar, hydro) and may also use natural gas.  When natural gas is used, the CO2 from the combustion is co-captured and permanently sequestered along with the atmospheric CO2, resulting in virtually no net emissions from the use of a fossil fuel.  All emissions from the plants are accounted for in the Life Cycle Analysis, and only the net removal is counted as a negative emission.   ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","Not applicable","A DAC facility has several measurable co-benefits, including water stewardship, land use, and inducing increased renewable energy generation.    Water Stewardship: Carbon Engineering’s DAC facilities utilize water in the process, but do not rely on fresh water supplies to run the operations.  Brackish and non-potable water can be sourced, which is then further treated for use in the DAC process.  By not relying on fresh water supplies, Carbon Engineering’s DAC facilities won’t adversely impact scarce water resources that communities rely upon for drinking water and agricultural use.     Land Use: Carbon Engineering’s DAC facilities can be sited anywhere including non-arable land, given that CO2 is ubiquitous in the atmosphere and can be captured equally in most locations. As such, DAC facilities can avoid sensitive locations and only require approximately 75 acres of land to capture 1 million tonnes from the atmosphere.      Renewable Energy: DAC requires a significant amount of electricity for capturing the CO2 and additional electricity to make renewable hydrogen for its AIR TO FUELSTM products.  Carbon Engineering plants will source renewable energy generated from wind, solar or hydro electricity.  DAC projects will be significant new purchasers of renewable energy, creating a new source of demand for renewable energy generation and helping increase development and investment into renewables projects.      In addition to these benefits, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (“LLNL”), in its recent report  focused on negative emissions opportunities in California, identified several socio-economic co-benefits of carbon capture and negative emissions:  •	Air quality improvements, by replacing fossil transportation fuels and reducing biomass combustion and wildfires  •	Water quality improvements, by enhancing and restoring natural ecosystems  •	Protection of life and property, by reducing wildfires  •	Economic development opportunities for the Central Valley and other areas in need  •	Keep California on the leading edge of technical innovation that will have a global impact  ","One of the unique aspects of DAC, given its locational flexibility, is that DAC projects can be located in developing countries and disadvantaged regions all over the world, while still earning credits in regulatory markets in wealthy regions.  For example, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which regulates carbon emissions, has established a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) in California to reduce the emissions from transportation fuels.  Direct Air Capture and geologic sequestration (DAC+S) are eligible for LCFS credits and because the atmosphere is a shared resource, CARB specifically allows DAC+S projects to be built anywhere in the world and still be eligible.  Because LCFS credits are a critical source of revenue for DAC facilities, this regulatory flexibility enables DAC projects to be built in markets that are themselves not wealthy or developed enough to generate the kind of carbon pricing markets necessary to build DAC plants.  In this way, DAC facilities enable these developing regions to participate in valuable markets which will help secure financing.    A DAC project can capture CO2 from the atmosphere anywhere in the world, making it the ideal climate mitigation tool for low income communities and developing countries that otherwise lack the natural resources, geography or natural climate to capitalize on an emerging decarbonization economy.  DAC projects are also “minor source emissions” facilities, which means they won’t be contributors to local air pollution issues or create any adverse environmental justice issues for members of a local community.    As an example, Carbon Engineering has been exploring the potential for a project in an underserved county in California in the southern San Joaquin Valley.  Kern County has one of the highest poverty rates of any county in California.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 20% of its population is in poverty. Additionally, much of Kern County has been identified as an Opportunity Zone or Low Income Census tract by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.  Both the Opportunity Zone program and the LIC tracts identify communities that are in need of investment due to their relative poverty rates and are eligible for federal tax incentives and funding.  Kern County is a good location for DAC development, in part because of its suitable geological storage resources and abundant renewable energy resources.  A project could be sited in Kern County (or any underserved community), which will contribute positively to their economy while giving them a powerful tool to help mitigate climate change.     For plant development in Canada, CE’s plant development partner Huron Clean Energy is adopting First Nations environmental stewardship values to create Canada-wide GHG negative infrastructure by deploying Carbon Engineering’s technology. This includes a goal of creating a true, mutually beneficial economic partnership with first nations across all provinces in Canada as they deploy commercial plants.     A Carbon Engineering DAC project, with a capital investment of over $1 Billion and hundreds of permanent, skilled operations jobs would provide a significant economic stimulus to any local community seeking to benefit from industrial development.

"Livelihoods Carbon Fund 3 (LCF3)","LCF3 provides a unique opportunity to scale-up a proven investment model which is a multi-stakeholder platform bringing together civil society organizations, local communities, private corporations, financial investors (both, public and private) and governments. Stakeholder consultation and engagement is the cornerstone of LCF3 innovative model, and the tool to establish a dialogue with interested parties and offer them maximum visibility into LCF3 processes and investments. LCF3 is positioned as a coalition between:  i.	Corporate investors keen on sourcing in-kind certified carbon offsets, as generated by LCF3, to compensate their uncompressible carbon footprint. These corporate investors represent both, historic LCF1 & LCF2 investors as well as newly entrant corporate investors attracted by LCF’s track-record of delivery of high quality & competitively priced carbon offsets;     ii.	Financial investors which can be a financial institution, a fund, a Development Finance Institution (DFI) or any other private or public entity investing with the intention to generate a social and/or environmental benefit in addition to a financial return;      iii.	Livelihoods Venture (LV) with a 10-year track-record investing in 15 large-scale carbon sequestration and avoidance projects in Africa, Asia and Latin America, scheduled to generate a total of 20 million t CO2e. LV has also been a driving force in the proposal for adoption of innovative carbon certification methodologies with international carbon certification bodies. For example, in partnership with ILRI, ICRAF & Gold standard Foundation, LV developed new methodologies to assess carbon generated from large-scale methane avoidance projects and carbon sequestered in the soil thanks to large-scale diffusion of sustainable agricultural practices projects. With institutional partners, LV also developed new methodologies for the large-scale carbon assessment of mangrove replantation projects. These methodologies have enabled LCF1 to launch & generate certified carbon offsets over 29,000Ha of mangrove projects. More recently, LV in collaboration with forest management and sustainable land use consultants Unique had approved, by voluntary carbon standard Gold Standard, a new methodology linking the impacts of adopting sustainable agricultural land management (SALM) practices including agricultural biodiversity on soils and water and uses soil erosion as a proxy to quantify water benefits.     iv.

LCF3 is an investment vehicle to directly finance greenfield carbon projects instead of buying already issued carbon offsets. As investment advisor, Livelihoods Venture (LV) co-designs projects with local developers and finances them in exchange for high quality carbon offsets at production cost. Investment decisions are based on principles applied by industrial companies in their operations: cost efficiency, results-focus and hands-on management.  ii.	LCF3 certifies carbon offsets under best-in class voluntary carbon offset standards (Gold Standard, Verra), but also embeds positive social and environmental impact into its core targets. Co-benefits are a key component and success factor of LCF3 projects, as LCF3 does not own any of the physical assets financed. Carbon projects are undertaken on smallholder farmers’ land, to which LCF3 holds no title nor to the trees financed by LCF3. Likewise, across mangrove restoration projects, land status is typically communal land.  These co-benefits are entirely captured by local stakeholders, do not constitute a financial return to LCF3 investors, and act as a powerful risk mitigation tool creating an incentive for projects’ assets (trees, etc...) to be well maintained over the long-run as they deliver tangible benefits to local stakeholders.  iii.	LCF3 investors diversify their sourcing of carbon offsets across a large portfolio of community-based solutions to restore natural ecosystems, facilitate access to rural energy, and establish agroforestry and regenerative agriculture systems worldwide in order to reduce and mutualize their investment risks. LCF3 will ultimately generate 20 million certified carbon offsets over its 24 years term.   iv.	LCF3 will adopt a dual dividend distribution mechanism to enable corporates to either a) receive offsets, at LCF3’s production cost, as an in-kind dividend or b) commit to offtake carbon offsets at a long-term pricing formula from LCF3’s financial investors while enabling the latter to receive cash dividends.   This mechanism will eliminate the demand risk for financial investors and, thanks to LCF1 & LCF2’s track-record, provide a visibility on expected financial returns. For corporates, the carbon offtaking mechanism will help mitigate the investment risk associated with carbon offset generation, allow them to focus financial resources on core-business activities and hedge future carbon offset markets.","Like its predecessors, LCF3’s portfolio of future carbon projects is expected to be geographically concentrated in the tropics.","Global","Global",0,67,0,0,"6/30/2021","For carbon sequestration projects, voluntary carbon standards, under which LCF3 projects will be registered and certified, have put in a place a sort of global insurance mechanism to ensure that carbon offsets earned by planting trees won’t literally go up in smoke if something, such as a fire, eventually happens to the forest. Afforestation/reforestation projects are therefore required to set aside non-tradable buffer offsets to cover unforeseen losses in carbon stocks. The volume of buffer offsets, on a project basis, are held by the Voluntary Carbon Standards (thus not distributed to LCF3 nor its investors) in a pooled buffer account, which can be drawn upon by the Voluntary Carbon Standards in the event of a reversal in carbon stocks in any individual project. Project buffers typically range between 10%-60% depending on a project’s risk profile and may vary throughout project life depending on local context.     The monitoring, reporting and recourse/compensation of these potential reversals are undertaken at regular intervals, every 3 to 4 years, in the context of the project’s carbon verification, in collaboration between LV and the project developer and is audited by an independent third-party for approval by the Voluntary Carbon Standards.

More specifically, for forestry projects, LCF3 will adopt several approaches to avoid actions that encourage deforestation or activities that would increase emissions, namely:    -	In collaboration with the project developer, when possible, raise-awareness and provide training to project beneficiaries on sustainable land management practices;  -	Secure a contractual commitment from the project developer to ensure that the project activities are undertaken on plots which have been non-forest since 1990; and   -	Refrain from investing into carbon projects that would increase emissions and only finance activities that are covered by already approved methodology (UNFCCC or Voluntary Carbon Standards).

Increase of the area of restored and conserved natural ecosystems by at least 88,400Ha. LCF3’s portfolio of projects is expected to include a mix of 1) avoided deforestation initiatives (10,700 Ha) including amongst others, rural energy, REDD+, or methane avoidance projects; and 2) carbon sequestration projects from mangrove & coastal habitat (16,500 Ha), agroforestry and sustainable agriculture (61,200 Ha). As such, at least 74 million trees are projected to be planted across the portfolio of projects. The type of trees selected will be based on inputs during design phase from various stakeholders (farmers, local economic actors, agronomical or scientific experts, etc.) on the merit and utility of the tree species.   II.	Increase the income of at least 475,500 direct beneficiaries as a result of participating in and benefiting from the portfolio of projects financed by LCF3. In addition, and within the scope of its climate investments, at least 100,000 farmers are expected to have completed a training on sustainable agriculture land management. Depending on the project context, the training will include multiple components from the following range of 9 categories: nutrient management, soil and water conservation, agronomic practices, agroforestry, tillage and residue management, restoration and rehabilitation, integrated livestock management, sustainable energy and integrated pest management.   LCF3 will also equip more than 210,000 women with improved cooking devices which are expected to at least halve their firewood consumption thus reducing deforestation, lower exposure to indoor pollution and reduce time spent, typically of female members of the household, on unremunerated activities such as fuelwood collection.  A key learning for LCF3 projects is that impact generation is the most powerful risk mitigation tool in all carbon projects over the long-term. Community-based projects will only be well stewarded and its assets (trees, etc.) well maintained over the long-run if they deliver tangible benefits for their local stakeholders. As such, 70,000 people are expected to enter into a sourcing agreement with one or several commercial entities, enabling them to capture more value across the value of chain of agricultural produce or services promoted under LCF3 projects. These commercial linkages may be directly facilitated through LCF3 creating and/or providing support to 650 collective organizations such as farmers cooperatives, collective storage spaces, natural resource management committees, business incubators, remunerated planting groups, etc.  III.	Women's empowerment. Special attention is paid to the condition and status of women and young girls, and consequently LCF3 investments will seek to increase women’s participation at all levels of the project, and especially increase their visibility and involvement in the decision-making process. As such, LCF3 activities will directly reach 316,500 women. Across these various project governance bodies (village committees, cooperatives, etc.), LCF3 aims to have at least a 50%–50% parity representation across the project governance bodies, as female participation across these governance bodies is a key success factor in the long-term sustainability of LCF3 initiatives.  IV.	Increased resilience and improved health of local communities. With a project portfolio expected to include at least 16,500 Ha of mangrove and coastal habitat restoration & conservation, LCF3 is expected to enhance the resilience and adaptation of coastal communities when faced with extreme weather events as exacerbated by of climate change (empirical and field-based studies have shown that 30 trees per 100 square meters may reduce the maximum flow of a tsunami by more than 90 percent ). When also factoring in benefits associated with avoided emissions projects, LCF3 is expected to benefit 210,000 people through lower exposure to health hazards and injuries over a period of at least 7 years.  V.	Sequester at least 20 million tons of CO2e emissions over 24 years through GHG avoidance and/or increased carbon sequestration in biomass, soil, and sediments thanks to the project activities). LCF3 will play a major role in supporting the Paris Agreement goal of increasing CO2 sequestration in the soil and vegetation in developing countries, while improving the lives of hundreds of thousand rural people (up to 1.5 million combining direct and indirect beneficiaries). That is to say that LCF3 will channel millions of dollars every year to help developing countries meet their climate objectives, protect and enhance their carbon sinks and improve people’s lives.","LCF3 carbon projects will be geographically concentrated in the tropics where 1) poverty levels are higher ; 2) imported deforestation (cacao, palm oil, soya, etc.) is more pronounced (e.g. between 2000–2011, 40% of tropical deforestation came from commodity crop production ); 3) trees grow faster and terrestrial biodiversity is richer ; and 4) fuelwood sourcing is more concentrated (inhabitants are estimated to consume c.1,400 million m3 of fuelwood per year  out of a total 1,954 million m3 of global fuelwood production in 2020 ). The majority of LCF1 & LCF2 investments to date have targeted the poorest communities across countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, including low, lower-middle, and upper-middle economies.    Poverty among small farmers is widespread and usually higher than the national poverty headcount rate (i.e. the share of the population below the national poverty threshold) . Worldwide, there are approx. 500 million smallholder households (accounting for c. 2 billion people) cultivating less than 2 Ha. These households are usually food insecure and make up a significant portion of the world’s poor who live on less than $2 a day .   Like previous funds, LCF3 will focus on improving the lives of small producers in rural areas (typically smallholder farmers, using mostly family labor, and deriving from agricultural activities a large but variable share of its income, in kind or in cash) by promoting the most appropriate agronomic practices and facilitating access to technologies that ensure greater productivity and enhance the value of their products, so they have better access to food and achieve greater economic autonomy.     Moreover, as Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities are the end-beneficiaries of LCF3 projects. LCF3 advocates for an early, direct engagement of project beneficiaries and their active involvement during project implementation to facilitate local ownership of the project.

The project aims to bring multiple social and environmental benefits by restoring forest cover in pastures and degraded areas, under four different models of plantation (agroforestry combined with cocoa; linear or intercropping plantations; pure stand, and silvopasture).      In 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated 70% of smallholders’ fields in Honduras, including many cocoa plots. This Project aims at supporting farmers who were affected by this natural disaster and in reviving the country’s cocoa farming tradition.

The project aims to bring multiple social and environmental benefits by restoring forest cover in pastures and degraded areas, under four different models of plantation (agroforestry combined with cocoa; linear or intercropping plantations; pure stand, and silvopasture).      In 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated 70% of smallholders’ fields in Honduras, including many cocoa prcels. This Project aims at supporting farmers who were affected by this natural disaster and in reviving the country’s cocoa farming tradition. Through tree planting and education activities,  this Project aims to restore degraded land and support farmers to adapt to climate change, diversify their income, support social cohesion and preserve historical and cultural methods of cultivation while developing a best-in-class cocoa value change.

The mass of CO? removed from the air can directly be measured as a physical flow of CO? that enters permanent storage. A comprehensive monitoring system detects leakage from the reservoir should it occur and follows the physical and chemical trapping of the CO? until it is converted to solid rock and permanently bound.   Dedicated flow meters, pressure and temperature sensors, and sampling valves are located near the injection well. These enable the quantification of the CO? being injected which together with tracer tests enable mass balance calculations used for the validation process of Carbon Mineralization.  Carbfix will monitor the Carbfix process primarily to validate that all injected CO? remains stored underground and that Carbon Mineralization of the injected CO? is taking place. The primary means of monitoring is through geochemical methods which are placed in context with reservoir models that are used for long term prediction of the fate of injected CO?. In addition to geochemical monitoring methods, a network of seismometers is in place for the detection of any possible seismicity that might take place in relation to the injection.  CO? flux through the surface is measured regularly and compared to background CO? fluxes that have been done in the past and will also be done few days prior to injection. These measurements provide indication that no gaseous CO? is escaping from the storage formation to the atmosphere.  A reservoir model of the injection site will be developed and calibrated based on tracer data to allow for accurate predictions of regional hydrology. Reactive transport simulations will be carried out to predict the rate and extent of Carbon Mineralization of the injected CO? and different parameters of the model will be recalibrated based on available monitoring data. Existing models and modelling experience for the reservoir accessed by the Carbfix wells will be utilized as a basis for these modeling activities.    Regular sampling and chemical analysis of fluids from monitoring wells provides an indication of chemical reactions (primarily Carbon Mineralization) occurring in the reservoir between the injection well and the monitoring well. Mass balance calculations taking data from injection well and monitoring well into account (including tracer data) enable quantification of Carbon Mineralization and additionally enable external validation of the Carbfix process. The chemistry of monitoring fluids will be used to validate reservoir models and increase confidence in their applicability for long term predictions of the fate of injected CO?.  Injection of fluids into the subsurface may lead to induced seismicity. The risk is considered low in this specific project since the fluid flows are low and comparable to Carbfix’ previous experience from the injection site. Carbfix will make use of a local seismometer network operated by ON Power to monitor any induced seismicity.  The risk of leakage is small for conventional CO? storage, as both the probability and consequence are small, as demonstrated by numerous pilot, demonstration and commercial projects and by scientific research such as the EU FP7 project RISCS. In the specific case of the Carbfix method for geological CO? storage, the risks are further significantly decreased or even excluded. Contrary to the conventional method of injecting pure CO? at supercritical conditions, in the Carbfix method the CO? is dissolved in water prior to injection. The resulting solution of carbonic acid has a higher density than the saline formation water present in the reservoir, such that the dissolved CO? is negatively buoyant. Hence, the risk of upward leakage through the cap rock is physically excluded. Furthermore, the highly reactive nature of the basaltic rock formations prevailing at the storage site enables rapid mineralization of the CO?, meaning the dissolved CO? reacts with rock minerals to form solid carbonates, such as CaCO3 (calcite). Carbfix has demonstrated the mineralization of 95% of the injected CO? within two years. In conventional CO? storage, dissolution and mineralization of the CO? require centuries to millennia. Thermodynamically, carbonates represent the lowest-possible energy level a carbon atom can attain and consequently, carbonate rocks are hardly reactive and environmentally benign. Leakage of CO? back into the atmosphere requires unusual conditions – for example direct contact with magma during the birth of a new volcano – and is highly unlikely to occur. Should it happen against all odds, the release of CO? would remain small as only a fraction of the mineralized CO? would be directly in contact with magma.  The consequences of water injection and production at the Hellishei?i geothermal power plant in Iceland are expertly understood and the monitoring system on site has been validated through more than a decade of geothermal operations. The characterization and monitoring of the storage reservoir goes beyond the high standards typically applied for CO? storage, primarily due to the fact that the CO? is stored directly in the geothermal reservoir. The geothermal operation motivated and funded the drilling of tens of boreholes for injection, production and monitoring. Each of these boreholes provides invaluable information about the subsurface and the extraction of the geothermal brine allows for the monitoring of the fate of the CO? in the reservoir with high accuracy. As an additional and redundant monitoring technique, the CO? flux from the top soil is measured continuously and compared to historical background data, in order to detect any unusual appearance of CO?.  ","Yes","Yes, the project will be certified by June 2021",,,,,,,,"The main motivation of capturing CO? from the atmosphere is its potential to help reverse climate change.  Climeworks carries out life cycle assessments of its technology on a regular basis with experienced university and industrial partners in order to quantify the environmental impact and, specifically, the actual amount of GHG reduced by a Climeworks DACS plant according to generally accepted standards and methodologies. Typical results show that the grey emissions of a Climeworks plant amount to less than 10% of the CO? captured, with a development goal towards <5%. These grey emissions are, as a matter of principle, subtracted, when selling carbon dioxide removal certificates to customers.  Specifically, the cradle-to-grave environmental impacts for Climeworks’ captured and sequestrated CO? will be continuously assessed and reviewed through external independent partners. The cradle-to-grave system boundaries include all processes associated with the supply of the product captured CO?, i.e. the construction, auxiliaries, energy supply and adsorbent for the DAC plant, recycling and disposal after lifetime, as well as with geological storage (i.e. carbon dioxide removal).  Our assessments focus on the environmental impact ‘climate change’. However, other environmental impacts are associated with our system and 15 further environmental impact categories have been assessed to determine potential environmental trade-offs and to detect potential burden shifting (incl. ozone depletion, particulate matter, acidification, eutrophication freshwater).  The function of DACS systems is to capture CO? from ambient air and subsequently permanently remove it. Hence, we define “1 kg CO? sequestrated” as a functional unit.  The results provided below are derived from the independent, third party financed study performed by researchers at the University of Aachen, Germany, based on Climeworks Life Cycle Inventory for the 3’000tCO? mt/y, being commissioned in 2020.  The main sources of GWP are the sorbent material, the energy used in the process and construction.  •	Climeworks CO? capture and sequestration process requires a mix of electricity and heat.  •	Electricity is used during operation of the plant, to pull air through the adsorbent, as well as for sequestration, where CO? is compressed and injected into an underground geological formation.  •	Thermal energy is needed to heat up the adsorbent in the collector to initiate the desorption of CO?.  •	The total global warming potential (GWP) contribution from the sorbent material depends on its manufacturing and disposal, as well as the lifetime of this material in our DAC plant.  •	Recycling of the metal parts of the plant at the end of life is considered when assessing the impact of the construction of the plant.  Taking into consideration a detailed analysis of these different inputs, we expect our DACS plants to reach a carbon removal efficiency (cradle-to-grave) of around 90% for today’s product generation and >90% for future plants, if the energy is provided from a renewable source, such as for example geothermal energy.     Future work:  The LCA of our entire product lifecycle is a critical aspect of Climeworks’ activities. This is why we have, for many years already, partnered up with researchers, universities and independent experts to support us in making independent reliable assessments of our products. We already provide our inventory to researchers and welcome critical assessment of our products. Future avenues to explore would include more detailed analyses of our supply chain, which we have already started by having some of our key suppliers’ environmental footprint independently assessed.  ","•	CO? removal can be measured directly as a physical flow of CO? that enters the permanent storage reservoir  •	Project activity is by definition “additional”. The baseline assumption is “no activity”.   •	Life-cycle project emissions from energy use, construction and operation of the DAC plant, etc. can be calculated according to established methods. Several independent life-cycle assessments for DAC exist as well as one specifically for the Orca plant.   •	Geological CO? storage is meant to be permanent by design, leakage only occurs in the case of unexpected failure. The (low) risk of leakage occurs mainly while CO? is injected and further decreases with time. The CO? will eventually be fully immobilized as precipitated carbonate rock material.   •	Scientific literature for Carbfix method: (1) 	Snæbjörnsdóttir, S.

With respect to infrastructure owned or used by Climeworks, it is noted that such infrastructure (for example facilities related to sinks) may allow local communities to benefit directly, for example by means of employment opportunities. Further, there are co-benefits from the installation of renewable energy infrastructure (for example grid enforcements/extensions, feed-in opportunities, local economic activity and investments) and it is acknowledged that electrification is one of the most important development factors (light, cooling for medication, etc.). First implementations of breakthrough technology can also attract touristic interest. More generally, Climeworks is not just developing a new solution, we are essentially creating a whole new industry. As we are not restricted by existing infrastructure, we can build this industry in a way that is particularly beneficial for disadvantaged or underserved communities.","Climeworks’ carbon dioxide removal solution has the potential to reach and benefit all mentioned communities.   While it is acknowledged that progressive industrialized economies may have to demonstrate CDR technologies at scale, future implementations will increasingly rely on the local availability of renewable energy and CO? storage opportunities, resulting in opportunities for developing economies. DAC, in particular, profits from the ubiquitous availability of its central feedstock – i.e. air – which allows to make use of local opportunities for low-carbon energy supply from solar, wind, geothermal or other renewable energy. Large-scale CDR implementation will foster investments in local energy infrastructure and provide jobs and education with a long-term perspective. The geological CO? storage potential exceeds the projected requirements by orders of magnitude and is distributed across the world in sedimentary basins and in the basalts of the sea floor and oceanic ridges.  Moreover, removing carbon dioxide from the air to reduce and ultimately reverse climate change benefits all communities globally, especially the ones at greatest risk from a changing climate as they often lack the means and resources to build a resilient economy.   More generally, Climeworks’ technology provides a solution for unavoidable as well as historic emissions, which greatly improves the discussion about climate responsibility. Additionally, the technology provides a realistic perspective for the sometimes abstract discussions around reaching net-zero or net negative emissions personally, locally, and globally. In terms of transitioning into lower-carbon economies, carbon dioxide removal services are a game changer for private individuals who feel helpless in the fight against climate change.   Furthermore, the development of DAC solutions has co-benefits for the energy transition. Air-captured CO? enables truly closed carbon cycles for de-centralized use of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels, making available a key tool to facilitate the energy transition. Synthetic fuels enable the long-term (i.e. seasonal) and large-scale storage of renewable electricity. Furthermore, they allow for sector coupling between the electricity sector and applications in mobility, chemistry and industrial heat. As such, synthetic fuels support the further increase of renewable energy generation capacity beyond the current receptivity of the electric grid.  Climeworks is not just developing a new solution, we are essentially creating a whole new industry. By building this industry sustainably, new job opportunities are created across different industries and skill levels (see for example https://rhg.com/research/capturing-new-jobs-and-new-business/) and it will also require upskilling. The impact of our solution - the reduction or even reversal of climate change - will ultimately benefit society as a whole.  ",,,,,,,,

Protecting an area more than 3.5 times the size of Manhattan, the project targets the Merang biodiversity corridor, one of the largest and deepest peat swamps in South Sumatra. Climate finance rehabilitates and protects this threatened ecosystem, reducing emissions, and creating a conservation area for hundreds of unique and endangered species. The project works with local communities from nearby villages to improve livelihoods which reduces pressure on the forest.     Climate finance supports several key activities to increase the resilience of the ecosystem through peat rewetting and reforestation:   Regeneration and regrowth of standing trees: A regeneration programme is restoring more than  22,900 hectares of degraded peatland forest with native tree and vegetation species, in what was  once one of the most biodiverse regions in the country. Regrowth is already evident across the fire zone, with peat depths measured as high as 5 meters in some places.  Fire prevention: During a large fire in 2015, the project fire prevention team successfully saved about 6,000 hectares of forest. Prevention of another large fire is of critical importance and the  project is working to block canals to prevent further drainage.  Forest monitoring: Ground teams patrol the project, monitoring the health of the landscape and using technologies such as drones and satellite-based Early Warning Systems to prevent fires  and illegal land clearance.

","Social Sustainability: A key aspect of the Sumatra Merang Peatland Project is to work with surrounding communities that rely on the landscape for their livelihoods. Through a profit-sharing mechanism, climate finance invests in community development and low-carbon livelihoods programs. Following a participatory assessment of needs in the local villages, the project supports a range of development initiatives alongside local communities that include contributing to public health campaigns, water/sanitation infrastructure, and education programs. Public health and water/sanitation are core challenges for local villages because they are situated directly on the river and have no access to clean water or sanitation infrastructure. This means they are highly susceptible to waterborne diseases. The project’s community working groups will work with community leaders to address these issues and invest funds to improve public health where appropriate. Climate finance contributes to developing sustainable livelihood programs with villages near the project including fishing and smallholder cropping of Sago, Jelutung, coconut and palm fruit. The most immediate impact is direct and indirect employment for canal dam construction and forest patrols with a target to make 25% of job created for women. Many of the local people actively fish in the project area, which provides both sustenance and income. The project efforts to rewet the peatland and protect watersheds also improves breeding grounds for  fish and therefore the livelihoods of many local people. The project works with local villages to develop capacity and market connections for sustainable fishing production, as small enterprises create lasting, positive change for local communities.

","Orangutan Habitat Restoration in Sumatra ","Orangutan Habitat Restoration in Sumatra ","n/a",,"The Sumatran Orangutan Society, in close partnership with ClimateCare, are developing this project as part of a strategic approach to support communities to protect, restore and safeguard orangutan habitats, whilst benefitting from critical ecosystem services and higher incomes. Field partners will develop bespoke forest restoration action plans with communities living next to key orangutan habitat, then provide training and tools to equip them with the skills and knowledge to benefit from, rather than exploit the rainforest ecosystem. Through training in agroforestry and organic farming techniques, this approach has shown that farmers can increase crop yields and improve their profit, reducing their need to expand farmlands into the forest. The holistic approach, with community livelihoods and engagement at its heart, is crucial for successful conservation efforts in the long term and is based on a CARE model: Community Agroforestry, Restoration and Education.    Regarding land ownership, with the exception of two of the sites (detailed below), the proposed restoration sites are all on state-owned land, in either protected areas or conservation areas. The community forestry sites and Conservation Partnership sites grant access to forest-adjacent communities to manage the land (overseen by ClimateCare's project partner), and the pure restoration sites will be under the exclusive management of our partners OIC (see below). The two exceptions are:    •	Selamanaya Hutan – this land is already privately owned by OIC; previously an oil palm plantation  •	Sekoci – this is a planned land purchase (pending funding) which would be privately owned by OIC; currently mixed community agriculture (800 ha) and intact forest (3,200 ha).    A contractual commitment with ClimateCare for future issuances of CDR credits from Microsoft will not only deliver the climate angle of carbon sequestration but an overall intervention that results in decreased pressure on the ecosystem, providing greater security for orangutans and the many other species that share their habitat, including humans.

Restoration project staff will closely monitor the security of the site (maintaining boots on the ground throughout) and will use conservation drones to detect any encroachment or disturbance of the young forest and monitor forest recovery. The project will also use a remote deforestation monitoring programme to track any forest loss within or adjacent to the portfolio of restoration sites (as well as the entire 2.6 million hectare Leuser Ecosystem). This will enable us to take swift action if any tree loss is detected, and monitor deforestation trends throughout the region in order to ascertain and get ahead of any risks to project sites.

","The wellbeing and prosperity of the people of Sumatra are inextricably linked to the fate of the forests, and millions of people depend on them for survival. The Leuser ecosystem is considered very vulnerable to climate change related events, and mitigating climate change ranks highly as both a development and conservation priority in the landscape, due to the economic and social impacts of climate change and related disasters.    The predicted impacts of climate change in Aceh province are expected to be severe, with 62% of the villages in Aceh regarded as vulnerable to climate change, according to a study by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The predicted economic loss from climate change and related disasters easily outweighs the costs of mitigation actions, including the protection of forest.       Floods in the Leuser landscape in 2006, 2012, and 2017 had severe economic impacts on the local population and economy. According to the Aceh flood damage and loss assessment, conducted in 2012, the economic loss in Gayo Lues was more than 53 Billion Rupiah (US$4 million) with the majority of the losses/damage sustained at household/individual level.     The restoration of lost and degraded forests, and the protection of intact forests through the proposed landscape restoration programme link conservation targets with broader development goals which are put at risk by climate change, such as poverty alleviation, food security and health, through maintaining and restoring ecosystem functions which are vital to protect Leuser’s forest adjacent communities.

","Restoring damaged forests and growing carbon credits ","Restoration of forests in Pematang Gadung, West Kalimantan, Indonesia",,,"1.  This is an attempt to use market forces to increase natural forest cover - not an agroforestry scheme, so the benefits are much greater for biodiversity.  2.  The costs per credit at $9.89 are very competitive for natural forest regeneration.  3. The scheme has been discussed at length with Plan Vivo so we are confident the project can be readily approved as a Plan Vivo scheme.  Note: if we use an ICROA compliant certification, it substantially increases the costs of the credits because ante credits can only be issued up to 10 years ahead and slow accumulation of carbon in the first years after planting mean that the costs per credit need to be substantially higher.  4.  The scheme has additional transparency with the proposed website operated by the Oxford Long-term Ecology lab and a webpage for every hectare of forest being regenerated.  5.  The scheme targets the frontline of deforestation in Indonesia - social forestry designated areas of forest and is ready to implement because OWT already have contracts in position to help with social forestry schemes. Gaining (Free Prior Informed Consent FPIC) to implement the scheme will be straightforward because of these existing working relationships and the ownership of the land is managed by a village committee that OWT already advise.  6.  The annual research teams participating in Opwall programs provide ‘free’ (ie funded from tuition fees not part of the credit costs) annual monitoring of biodiversity so the benefits of the scheme on various taxa can be quantified.  7. The local communities gain 61% of the payments from the credits and overall 77% of the income is paid in-country.  8. The proposed scheme is for 200,000 credits but it can be scaled readily to millions of credits with available social forestry land areas that are currently on the road to destruction and where interventions like this would help.  Likewise, it can be scaled down since each social forestry scheme will have patches of forest funded through different sponsors.  9. The scheme has the opportunity to show how carbon credit funding could provide a market solution to increasing natural forest cover worldwide.   ","Ketapang","West Kalimantan","Indonesia",200382,67,3,97,"10/1/2020","The Plan Vivo scheme retains 20% of the credits issued and these are never issued to the developer.  Plan Vivo maintains them as a ‘bank’ of credits that can be used if there is a catastrophic loss such as an uncontrolled fire.  In addition, the estimated levels of carbon storage after 25 years are significantly lower than likely to be achieved.  The forest plots being managed start off with between 50 – 100 tonnes per ha and have large numbers of saplings already growing.  On top of this, there will be additional planting, but saplings already growing in the plots will be off to a faster start than newly planted saplings. Opwall measurements of lowland forest in Indonesia that have been undisturbed for at least 25 years estimate carbon levels from 200 – 250 tonnes per ha and mature lowland forest has much higher carbon (400 - 500 tonnes per ha).  So, an estimate of 150 tonnes per ha after 25 years when they start at between 50 – 100 tonnes is very conservative.  However, what happens once the 15 years of annual payments is reached and the community over- harvests the forest? When the payments stop, the scheme allows the community to take 2.5% of the trees per year which puts the whole scheme on a 40 year rotation. This provides a strong sustainable income and by creating a mixed age forest, is likely to improve the biodiversity. Over harvesting will reduce the carbon stocks and remove the possibility of a second batch of carbon credit funding (for the next 25 years) to take the total carbon stored from 150 tonnes per ha to say 300 tonnes per ha, thus removing the long term income potential for the community.

CO2-SUICOM could achieve its CO2 reduction and removal from 2 typical features,  1) Special additive ”?-C2S” (dicalcium silicate ? phase : ?-2CaO?SiO2) and blast furnace slag etc are used to replace cement in concrete. These materials have very low level of CO2 emissions and contribute to reduce 200kg of CO2 per 1m3 concrete compared to normal concrete.  2) CO2 is captured in the concrete by a carbonation curing chamber. ?-C2S reacts with CO2 and creates a very dense concrete, contributing to remove 100kg of CO2 per 1m3 concrete.  These 2 features together could achieve maximum ~300kg reduction/removal of CO2 from 1m3 concrete, which is equivalent or higher of what a normal concrete will emit from its production lifecycle.

Through focused training, leadership development, and sharing of Best Practices, Small Groups of 6-12 TIST farmers develop tools to responsibly and sustainably care for their local environment, local biodiversity, the global climate, and the health and well-being of their families and communities.     Since 1999, TIST farmers have identified the local challenges they face and develop locally appropriate practices to address them. Through these practices, TIST farmers generate over $8 of CCBA Verified value for every tree planted, in the form of increased shade, stream bed stability, reduced soil erosion, windbreaks, firewood, medicine, fruits, nuts, and other tangible benefits. TIST's rotating approach to leadership means that women are active leaders at all levels of the Program. Although few women in Kenya have 'title deed' to land, over 40% of the TIST participants in Kenya are women, while both employees and management are 50% women. To support this gender parity, TIST uses a Payment for Environmental Services (PES) model that does not require land ownership, only demonstrated access to the trees on the land. This system supports full participation by women and youth.     To join the TIST Program, each Small Group signs a contract with CAAC for a term of 60 years, agreeing to plant and maintain TIST trees. CAAC has developed innovative procedures for monitoring, quantifying, and tabulating the carbon stocks in the TIST trees. In simplified terms, CAAC-trained TIST Quantifiers visit each grove (a privately-owned land where tree planting occurs, usually a smallholder farm) approximately once every 18 months, to count trees and collect tree circumference, GPS location, and other data. Each TIST Quantifier is audited both in the field and on the computer. Once the data is collected, the TIST Quantifiers transmit the data via a specially designed smartphone app to the TIST database, where it is managed by CAAC and publicly available for review online.     TIST's award-winning monitoring system also records the TIST farmers' progress to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals, advancing at least 12 of the SDGs.

Normal, nature-based risks associated with forestry (fires, insects, droughts, etc.) are dramatically less for TIST because of the small, disparate tree groves owned by TIST farmers. Tiny tracts of land owned by subsistence farmers are not at risk of land seizure. The project is distributed across large areas of each operational country. TIST has verified the minimum risk rating in each of the program's VCS PDs.      TIST contracts with farmers for 60 years, during which time they agree to maintain the tree groves they have planted on their properties. In addition to the contractual obligation, TIST provides on-going sustainable development training that encourages the long-term maintenance of the trees. Farmers are incentivized to maintain the trees because, so far, they have received over $8 in monetized benefits per tree, exceeding any of the carbon benefits from the trees. However, with a strong sales price to Microsoft, the profit share to the farmers' increases, providing a further incentive to maintain the trees on their farms and replace them as they die.     TIST monitors all of its trees and project areas approximately every 18 months. During the monitoring, all trees in a project area are counted, and a statistically significant number are measured. This information is used to determine the cumulative biomass and carbon removals.  It is compared to the amount removed during the prior monitoring periods, so that the net change in removal can be established. A gain becomes new credits. A loss would mean a reversal.  Because TIST has multiple PDs and is growing all the time, TIST can mitigate any reversals.    All of the credits to be sold to Microsoft are verified under Verra's VCS standard. As an A/R project, we, and all other A/R projects, have been placing at least 10% of our credits into a buffer account to guarantee against loss or reversals.

By virtue of being verified as CCB Gold for Exceptional Community Benefits, the TIST Program has demonstrated significant measurable co-benefits. The CCB surveys consist of in-depth interviews with a subset of TIST farmers that measure participant livelihoods through five main types of capital, including social, human, financial, physical, and natural. Results from these CCB surveys of TIST farmers show that participants experience a range of economic benefits and positive social impacts, regardless of socioeconomic status or gender. The most important benefits and impacts were sales and savings from tree products such as fruits, nuts, and firewood sales and use of tree seedlings, increases in crop yield due to Conservation Farming methods, increased social support and leadership skills, and increased knowledge and use of preventative health measures. In fact, TIST farmers generate over $8 of CCBA Verified value for every tree planted    The TIST Program is currently quantifying impacts on 12 Sustainable Development Goals (""SDGs"") and tracking its impact on all 17 SDGs. Because of its robust monitoring system, the Program was selected to pilot new strategies for quantifying SDG impacts with Verra's SDVista standard. As with the CCB verification, many of the SDG metrics are obtained from surveys conducted by the TIST program. The surveys were conducted in a semi-structured environment, by teams of experienced local TIST volunteers, across a range of clusters and geographies.    Monitoring is done periodically as part of the overall monitoring of TIST. TIST Quantifiers collect data as they visit each Small Group to count trees by species and count fuel-efficient stoves. Trainers collect training information at meetings, which include the subjects covered and the quantity of people attending.     TIST's approach to program organization and project management also supports the local community. Small Groups form the foundational blocks of TIST, facilitating the exchange of Best Practices and maximizing accountability on a local level. Certain Best Practices support the Small Groups' success, including rotating leadership between men and women, weekly meetings, preventing one person from dominating the discussion, accepting viewpoints without criticism, and identifying Best Practices specific to the environment of the Small Group.    Finally, researchers at the University of Exeter have detected a greening effect from TIST, using remote sensing. These landscape effects represent a benefit to the surrounding community beyond just the participating TIST farmers.  ","The TIST Program was formed by and for subsistence farmers who experience disproportionate impacts of climate change, ranging from inadequate food supplies and fuel sources to degraded land and irregular weather patterns. TIST farmers are fighting back by planting trees and improving their farms by practicing conservation farming. CAAC acts as a bridge between these subsistence farmers and the carbon markets, channeling substantial carbon financing to these low-income communities in the form of prepayments and 70% profit sharing.    The TIST Program is structured to eliminate economic and social barriers to participation.  Anyone can join TIST at no cost. Carbon payments are made using a Payment for Environmental Services (PES) model that does not require land ownership. This system supports full participation by women and youth. Those with neither land, nor access to land, can still receive TIST training, materials, and resources for free.    At the local, regional, and national levels, TIST achieves gender parity in leadership roles. Through the practice of rotational leadership, new Cluster leaders are elected to serve 4-month terms, alternating by gender. This develops local leadership capacity and identifies promising female leaders. Each country is managed by a gender-equal cohort of people from that country. CAAC does not employ any expatriates in its operating countries.     Instead, TIST employees and contractors are men and women working within their communities. The Program draws upon a diverse group of trainers and Quantifiers that come from across various tribes, religious groups, ethnic groups, language groups, and geographies. These workers are an accurate reflection of the diverse groups found within TIST's 93,000+ participants.    Kenyans run the TIST- Kenya Program. The 60-plus TIST Quantifiers are TIST farmers trained to monitor, quantify, and tabulate the carbon stocks in the TIST trees. We do not have formal education requirements for any position. Those that have proven they can do the job are the ones doing the job. And we ensure access to develop skills by holding regular training seminars for Quantifiers and conducting regular audits to make sure their skills are honed.

"Native, a Public Benefit Corporation","The Northern Rangelands Trust (“NRT”): The Northern Rangelands Trust is a membership organization started in 2004. They work for 39 community conservancies across 4.2million hectares of northern and coastal Kenya, fundraising and providing access to training, advice, and technical expertise. Community conservancies are local institutions, run for and by indigenous people. NRT’s mission is to develop resilient community conservancies, which transform people’s lives, secure peace and conserve natural resources.  NRT supports these communities to govern their wild spaces, identify and lead development projects, build sustainable economies linked to conservation, spearhead peace efforts to mend years of conflict, and shape government regulations at National and County level to support it all.    The Conservancies: The project consists of 13 participating conservancies in northern Kenya: Biliqo Bulesa, Il Ngwesi, Kalama, Leparua, Meibae, Melako, Naibunga, Nakuprat-Gotu, Namunyak, Nasuulu, Oldonyiro, Sera, and Westgate. The conservancies are each a set of communities, typically dominated by a particular ethnic group that have joined together to set aside lands for wildlife and other types of conservation. Their goal is to provide security for livestock and wildlife and make better use of lands to maintain cultural traditions, diversify livelihoods, and reduce poverty.   The Nature Conservancy (“TNC”): TNC facilitates community-based conservation projects throughout eastern and southern Africa. They implement a strategy of building local capacity to manage lands and resolve conflicts between competing land uses and conservation. TNC has provided financial, technical, strategic and operational support to the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) soil carbon project since 2012, when the project began. TNC strongly supports the NRT soil carbon project because it is one of the first examples of a carbon removal project in grasslands. Most other grassland carbon projects focus on avoided emissions from land conversion. We believe that revenue from a carbon market is essential to ensuring that pastoralists implement the grazing practices that build soil carbon and lead to resilient rangelands for people and nature.   Soils for the Future, LLC (“SFF”) is a soil carbon project consultant that is responsible for the implementation, design and monitoring of project activities, including soil and vegetation sampling, satellite imagery interpretation and biodiversity surveys   ","Kenya Sustainable Grasslands Management Project","Northern Kenya Grassland Carbon Project","https://native.eco/project/northern-kenya-improved-grasslands-project/",,"The Northern Kenya Grassland Carbon Project aims to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by implementing sustainable grazing management over nearly 2 million hectares of northern Kenya savannas and grasslands. Active, planned grazing and livestock movements in each of 13 different Conservancies will incentivize more sustainable grazing practices across pastoral communities. Rapid movement allows the recovery of perennial grasses increasing carbon inputs, retention of carbon as lignin and cellulose, and belowground carbon production; all of which lead to the drawing down of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere into soil carbon.  The planned rotational grazing project activity, implemented across 2 million hectares of rangeland,  will remove between 0.6 and 1.0 tons CO2e per hectare each year for at least thirty years. The project has been validated and will be verified to VCS VM0032 standard and is CCBA Triple Gold certified.  The Northern Kenya Grassland Project will also ensure future climate resiliency to a much larger area of Northern and Central Kenya. Past overgrazing by pastoralists from more than six indigenous ethnic groups in the Northern Kenya region has depleted soils of organic matter, greatly reduced perennial vegetation cover, drastically decreased the production of forage for livestock, and limited large migrations of native fauna, such as the elephant.    The sustainable planned grazing implemented in the project will restore grass and other livestock forage, which will provide buffers against variable rainfall and reduce the need for long and risky migrations during droughts. Restoration of grass will increase the climate adaptability of local communities because soils with more carbon store more water and sustain greater forage production through dry periods. Water retained in soils will also improve surface water availability.   Historically northern Kenya has been a hotbed of insecurity with frequent clashes between the 19 different ethnic groups that exist within the landscape, direct pressures resulting from drought and climate change, poaching incidences and the subsequent effects of organized crime on local communities and constant competition over resources, including pasture. Through NRT governance structures and programs in peace and security, as well as rangeland management, this historically fragile landscape is becoming more peaceful, secure and resilient. The carbon program promotes and incentivizes better management of community resources for the benefit of the very communities that own them, the revenue supporting the structures that enable this work to happen on the ground.

Major movements of livestock off the project area and/or departures from grazing plans are evaluated on a quarterly basis. Reversals are unlikely because even in worst-case annual scenarios only a limited amount of previously accrued carbon can be lost. The main reversal threat to grassland projects worldwide is conversion to cropland, but the climate and soils in the project area largely preclude that possibility.

The baseline case is pastoralists chasing the best grasses across the landscape, with associated conflicts with other tribes and wildlife competing for those grasses.  As a result, the best grass gets over-grazed and does not receive sufficient rest. The project activity brings all conservancies together to develop and agree upon grazing plans that allows everyone sufficient forage without over-grazing particular regions. Any attempt to shift the tendency to over-graze particular areas and to distribute grazing more broadly is an environmental benefit. There are not increases in emissions associated with this work, other than the staffing and transportation of the grazing coordinators within each conservancy. All baseline and project emissions are tracked and accounted for within the net project removal quantification validated to VCS/CCB and included in the PDD.    From the social impact perspective, per CCB requirements, the project tracks the social impacts of the project activity as compared to baseline. In addition to stakeholder meetings, mechanisms for grievance and feedback, the project includes social surveys of the conservancies annually. These parameters are monitored at each project verification.    In addition, NRT ensures any negative social and environmental issues are prevented. NRT’s mission is to develop resilient community conservancies that transform people’s lives, secure peace and conserve natural resources. Through locally-led governance structures that complement traditional, indigenous systems, NRT supports peace and security programs. Within each conservancy, dedicated grazing coordinators support the development of annual grazing plans that complement those in neighboring conservancies. NRT also works to develop sustainable business and revenue streams to conservancies to build off traditional systems and relieve pressure on the grasslands.

Optionally, you may wish to note any alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals and any other specifications (e.g., Gold Standard, SDVista, FSC, Fair Trade).    The project is Triple Gold Level certified to the Climate, Community, and Biodiversity Alliance standard. The project activities support efforts towards the following Sustainable Development goals:  (Please see Attachment 1, the validated project description, for further detail)    Poverty (SDG1) - providing a focus for Government investments in social and economic development, and stimulating diversification and growth of household income and the green economy (SDG 8)  Social exclusion and gender equality (SDG 5 & 10), providing a voice and empowerment for women and youth   Climate change adaptation (SDG 13), enabling communities to better cope with climate shocks, adapt to a future changing climate and build more resilient ecosystems  Depleted natural resources (SDG 14 & 15) stabilizing, recovering and sustainably managing northern Kenya's rangeland, forest and marine resources, tackling the illegal wildlife trade which plagues society and wildlife and protecting endangered wildlife species  Insecurity, building peace and security in remote areas and strong accountable local institutions (SDG 16)  ADDITIONAL DETAILS  Goal  Target  Supporting Project Activity/Outcome  1. No Poverty  1.1 Eradicate extreme poverty, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day  Improvement of forage production and water availability from project grazing management activities will allow higher production of meat and milk and steadier production through dry periods and drought. Enhanced wildlife populations      1.3 Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters      2. Zero Hunger  2.3 Double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment  Project has already increased the average availability of milk, milk sales by women. Project develops community plans to ensure equal access to grazing lands for all livestock owners      2.4 Ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.  Restoration of rangelands to increase cover of perennial grasses will increase the health and number of livestock that can be sustainably produced on the landscape. The improved hydrology from increased soil carbon and grass cover will allow surface water to be available closer to settlements and for longer times into the dry season. The possibility exists for the pastoralist system to shift to a more sustainable livestock production system focused on yielding animals for market rather than a livestock-keeping system focused on holding animals as assets against ongoing declines in rangeland conditions.  4. Quality Education  4.4. Substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship  Project revenues will support bursaries that help provide educational opportunities for the poorest community members, most of whom come from households without livestock. Project employment provides training in field and natural history skills, data management and accounting, planning, and social research, all of which feedback to increase the human capital within Conservancies and decrease reliance of communities on NRT and other assisting organizations      4.A Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, nonviolent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all  Communities will have the opportunity to invest project revenues into educational facilities, new teachers, and/or educational materials. As part of the effort to mobilize livestock, these opportunities can be offered to communities away from main villages and settlements.  8. Economic Growth  8.3 Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services  One of NRT’s 4 Strategic Objectives in its Strategic Plan 2018-2022 is to invest in community priorities for improving their lives and create the conditions for growing jobs and businesses. NRT and the community conservancies are collectively one of the biggest employers in the landscape. The number of permanent NRT and NRT Trading employees now is 278 whilst member conservancies employ 1,066 people.   Through NRTs Conservancy Livelihood Fund NRT invests in viable projects that ensure economic stimulus, social empowerment and human development that respond to local needs and build on conservancy management plans. The fund can also be used to leverage other livelihood finance from County Governments and others to build sustainably, develop partnerships and maximise impact.   Further, NRT works with communities to generate household income, diversify the local economy and provide a driver of change from enthic conflict and criminality, with an aim of generating conservancy-level income from conservation. NRT-owned business incubator NRT Trading provides business extension services and financial literacy through structured NRT Trading support, training, Savings And Credit Cooperative Organisation (SACCO) investments and marketing to create house-hold level jobs and small businesses.          8.9 Devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products  Rangeland improvements associated with mobile grazing and implementation of grazing plans will support greater and more widely dispersed wildlife populations, thereby improving prospects and quality of ecotourism opportunities.  15. Biodiversity  15.3 Combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world  Implementation of grazing plans will directly improve the productive capacity of the land by restoring perennial grass cover and soil organic matter, thereby increasing water infiltration and spreading out hydrological cycles. These dynamics will reduce flooding and make water available for people and livestock across a greater portion of the year. The project will not only halt degradation, it will recover lands to their potential.      15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species  Implementation of grazing plans will improve habitats on Conservancy lands and reduce degradation of nearby forests. These forests have been increasingly used during droughts as the surrounding rangeland degraded. The project reverses this project and protects the unique biodiversity associated with the cloud forest “islands” and protected game reserves that interdigitate with the project area.      15.7 Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products  Game scouts supported by carbon project revenues to Conservancies have already dramatically reduced elephant mortality and, together with some range improvements led to an expansion and increase in densities of wildlife populations, including several threatened, endangered and endemic species.      15.8 Introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species  Carbon project revenues can be used by Conservancies to engage in restoration activities which include removing invasive trees such as Acacia reficiens, and re-seeding and using “management” short-term livestock corrals to accelerate the recovery of the most degraded rangelands.  16. Peace and Justice  16.5 Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms  The governance and management structures implemented through the community conservancy model are transparent and Boards and management are both trained and held accountable in their roles to reduce corruption and bribery. Internal audits are completed on each conservancy once every two years and a financial audit on a conservancy’s accounts is completed on an annual basis.       16.6 Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels  The governance structure implemented through the community conservancy model forms the basis of all organization and management in each of the participating conservancies in the project. This is based on an elected, rotating Board that is representative of each community within that conservancy and ensures that Board decisions, management practices and financial systems are effective, accountable and transparent. Audits of each conservancy are completed on an annual basis.       16.7 Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels  The project helped build the capacity of smallholders, women, and minorities to participate in the project. Each year of the monitoring period, families from these groups provided personnel for project-related employment, including game scouts, soil and vegetation surveyors, social surveyors and livestock herding. Community members were also employed each year of the monitoring period as processors of vegetation, wildlife, and social data. Education efforts by grazing coordinators and NRT and SftF personnel were provided to women and children in Kalama, Westgate, Meibae, Naibunga, and Melako Conservancies in 2014 and 2016      16.A Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime  The presence of pastoralists engaged in sustainable economic activity in these semi-arid landscapes serves as a bulwark against activity and recruitment of terrorist groups, such as Al Shebab, that otherwise might operate extensively in northern Kenya.  ","The target stakeholders for this project are pastoralist communities in Northern Kenya. Access to carbon finance is not readily available to them as they lack the ability to validate and verify a complex and unprecedented soil carbon project and to sell those credits to multinational buyers. Rangeland improvements associated with project activities have already and will continue to benefit community members from multiple ethnic groups with peaceful access to dry season grazing, livestock-to-market programs and technical assistance. Education programs focused on improving grazing planning have helped provide a focus for community conversation and better and more transparent governance within communities.    The impacts of climate change are acute and in the forefront for these pastoralists. Without support to manage grazing with the other diverse competing interests for the limited forage, the land is rapidly degrading. The degradation increases pressure and conflict. The drought in 2017 was the most profound evidence of the violence and upheaval in the region from the impacts of climate change. Through improved grazing practices, these communities can develop resilience to the effects of climate change. The project provides employment, access to education and health care in the form of distributions from community bursaries, and increased access to milk and water for households headed by women and the poorest 25% that largely do not own livestock. Grazing planning and carbon benefits are offered to all ethnic groups, even small minorities within each Conservancy.    The project targets the most underrepresented and under-resourced communities in Kenya by supporting them to manage their natural resources more sustainably. This is done through developing locally-led governance structures, running peace and security programs, providing trained grazing coordinators to each conservancy, grazing management training, financial support to conservancies, supporting development of sustainable businesses linked to conservation, and advocacy on relevant government policy. Project benefits extend even to households that do not own livestock through bursaries and increased access to water and milk. Eventually, shifts of livestock enterprises to focus on livestock production for cash payments will benefit community members engaged in alternative livelihoods such as small businesses or service jobs (teaching, health care, transportation, etc..

Although the central management staff and computer development are in the US, the Kenya program is run by Kenyans from the Meru and Nanyuki area. The 60 plus Quantifiers are TIST farmers trained to use the monitoring system. The land and trees planted belong to the TIST farmers. The TIST farmers work together to establish the best practices for their area. The local managers are the Leadership Council, which is made up of Kenyan farmers. Kenyans run cluster meetings and Small Group meetings. All TIST participants have an opportunity to be group leaders, regardless of education or gender. TIST participants are utilized as volunteers, independent contractors, and employees based on achievement, not gender, education, or social status. And finally, TIST farmers receive 70% of the profit from carbon sales.  •	TIST strives for gender equality. About half of our Cluster Servants/Quantifiers, Auditors, Cluster Leaders, and Leadership Council are female. Females hold positions of responsibility, like voucher payments and expansion. When Seminars are held, Clusters must send at least one man and one woman. When a Cluster shows up with all males, they are sent home with instructions to send a woman.    •	Opportunities and benefits are open to all, especially marginalized people. TIST does not have a formal education requirement for any position. Those that have proven they can do the job are the ones doing the job. And we ensure access to develop sills by holding regular training seminars for Quantifiers and conducting regular audits to make sure their skills are honed.  Our CCB monitoring reports demonstrate the monetized benefits received by the marginalized participants.  ",,,,,,,,

The project supports subsistence farmers as they combat poverty, deforestation and climate change through tree-planting. The project adopts an innovate, community-led approach to tree planting and reforestation by ensuring that local people manage the project on their farms and in their communities.   The project will deliver carbon dioxide removal by encouraging small groups of farmers to plant and maintain trees on degraded and/or unused land, restoring what a century ago was dense forest. In 2019, around 300,000 t CO2 e was sequestered. Planting trees counteracts the devastating effects of deforestation, erosion, famine, droughts and floods. The trees planted in thousands of groves and land parcels are beginning to reduce erosion, stabilize and enrich the soil, and will soon be providing shade. In the future, they will provide other benefits which includes edible fruits and nuts, medicines, windbreaks, firewood and timber.   Small Groups benefit from new income from the sale of carbon credits that result from the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere, in the biomass of the trees and soil.

The land is under legally recognized co-management where DNPW partners with the bordering communities to protect the forest, increase tree cover and implement livelihood activities in border areas. These rural communities, struggling with dire poverty, are often forced to unsustainably deplete natural resources. The Kulera Program is designed to reduce deforestation and degradation in Malawi and bring more trees to the landscape transforming impoverished villages into prosperous, empowered communities who are committed to sustainable natural resource use. The partners include the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DNPW), Nyika-Vwaza Association (NVA), the Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve Association (NAWIRA), and Terra Global.     The Program provides critical resources for communities to protect their forests and increase food security though implementing co-management in the protected area, climate-smart agriculture, tree planting, woodland management, fuel-efficient cookstoves, and building alternative livelihoods that include non-timber forest products – planned by the communities themselves. These communities, fighting food insecurity, are implementing a household-level solar program bringing light to rural villages as well as growing and producing cash crops and value-added products.      To date the Program has been successful in conserving some of the last natural forests in Malawi, but also produces carbon removals through tree planting for woodlots (afforestation in border areas to address fuel wood needs), improved management of woodlands in border areas (coppicing, firebreaks, pruning to increase growing stock for fuel wood) and forest carbon stock enhancement (through regrowth of degraded forests in protected areas). Through the Kulera Program, forests have been conserved and have grown, removing more carbon from the atmosphere. These removals are in addition to the avoided forest carbon loss and was verified thorough on-ground biomass measurements conducted in 2019. The Kulera Program has planted thousands of trees for communities to have a sustainable supply of fuelwood and building material. Although this is a key component for livelihood improvements and energy sustainability these woodlots were never measured for carbon content. The standing biomass of woodlots is a direct removal. The Kulera Program will quantify carbon removals under the VCS/CCB. In addition, through the Program hundreds of hectares of community woodlands are better managed.

The program works to engage and empower rural people dependent on forest resources who have faced systemic barriers to accessing carbon finance. Malawi is the 6th poorest country in the World and this program provides support for 350,000 people who have been disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. The program follows a Theory-of-Change where project proponents defined long-term goals needed to reach a healthy, sustainable, and climate-resilient future, and specific activities were identified as a necessary precondition. Specifically, the Carbon Dioxide Removal is a co-benefit to the Kulera Program certified triple-gold though the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard demonstrating the highest certification for climate adaptation and mitigation, community well-being and biodiversity protection and enhancement. This program follows strict requirements for Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of specific outcomes, data points gathered are listed below. Although the Kulera Program touches all SDGs, the most significant SDGs are listed below.      SDG 1 - No Poverty  One of the fundamental goals of the Kulera Program is to reduce poverty through conserving biodiversity, demonstrating that development can be a partner to conservation.  As most people in the program area live on less than $1.25 per day, our project actions are structured to improve local livelihoods by facilitating income-generating activities and expansion of non-timber forest products in the area.   The communities targeted by the program are dependent on natural resources and rainfed annual crops (the majority being corn). The program supports farmers in using techniques and crops that will help them become more resilient to climate change. Also, by promoting and building capacity in alternative income-streams (e.g. honey, mushrooms, coffee, macadamia, fruit, solar sales), communities gain increased incomes from sustainable forest management and more independence from climate-related shocks and disasters. Through these same tools, the Kulera Program also promotes increased access to financial markets and value-chain links for local producers.    SDG 2 - Zero Hunger  As most communities in the project area rely on rainfed annual crops, Kulera Program's focus on promoting crop diversification, improved crop varieties and supporting animal husbandry helps create food year-round. In addition, improved agriculture technology transfer helps make communities be more productive and grow more food on less land.  The program supports animal husbandry of small-scale livestock of goats, chickens and pigs through community clubs. This provides the protein desperately needed by communities to reduce malnutrition.   Most communities in the project area rely on rainfed annual crops, have very low to no income, and often face food scarcity. All inputs in the program support these small-scale farmers in crop diversification, and improved crop varieties. These inputs are helping communities grow more food on a smaller amount of land, increasing their crop productivity and overall incomes.   The program supports conservation agriculture, which helps with soil and water conservation as well as reduced fertilizer inputs. Practices such as mulching, crop residue management, manure management, hedgerows, and agroforestry, as well as the use of improved varieties help crops become more resilient to a changing climate.      SDG 5 - Gender Equality  The Community Associations legal frameworks require at least 30% women involvement in governance within the association bylaws. In both Associations, women are in the Executive Committee. Further when the initial design of the program was developed, social surveys conducted in the region required to include women and under-represented minorities to participate in order to tailor the program activities to promote equality and improve the livelihoods of traditionally underserved groups.  The program activities that primarily benefit women include fuel efficient cookstoves to reduce time collecting fuel wood and reduce smoke and promotion of ground nuts and soy which are primarily cultivated by women. In the Kulera GotLights Solar program promoted women sales agents, who were trained to us mobile technology to sell lights on credit and generate incomes from commissions on sales.    SDG 6. Clean Water and Sanitization  The Kulera Program supports the use of agriculture practices and integrated pest management that reduces the need for herbicides and pesticides, creating less water-born pollutants. Activities promoted through the project such as swales, residue management, and hedgerows help directly reduce run-off into surface water used for drinking. Further, the Kulera Program helps maintain natural forests, which serve as critical bio-filter for the water in the area. The Kulera Program protects forested areas that are headwaters to Lake Malawi an UNSCO World Heritage Site. The Kulera Program contains miombo forest, afro-montane forests, and the extreme highlands of the Nyika Plateau, which translates to “where the water comes from.” These areas are identified as an IUCN Biodiversity Hotspot and protection of these lands are critical for providing drinking water.    SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy  The Kulera GotLights Solar program brings household solar lights to very rural households. Communities in the area have less than 1% electrification rate and are able to purchase a high-quality solar light on credit. Kulera GotLights Solar Program’s business model leverages the governance structures and network established under the program, by selling lights through a community-based network of sales agents.   The target market is the ~350,000 communities involved in the Kulera Program living in the 10km buffer zone of three protected areas in Northern and Central Region in Malawi.  The solar lights reduce the use of non-renewable batteries and wood fuel for fire for light.  Having household solar light promotes income generating activities that can be done at night, while conserving forest resources at the edges of three protected areas in Malawi. Women are particularly impacted as there is a reduction in fuelwood collection and households save money by not buying non-renewable batteries. This also reduces waste when flashlights and batteries are improperly deposed of within the countryside.    SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth  The Kulera Program creates Income Generating Activities (IGAs) such as honey production, mushroom production, sale of solar lights, and production of macadamia nuts. These jobs are designed to increase incomes of individuals, while keeping community members safe and with jobs in and around their forests.  These also contribution to SDG indictor 1 – no poverty, but they go beyond this by providing opportunities for next generations to live a new and interesting livelihood with income benefits to stay within their rural village.  The Department of Parks and Wildlife provides job opportunities working in the protected areas as guards, as well as through their extension and education program on conservation and anti-poaching,   Women are employed and paid the same as their men counterparts, and by-laws are in place for workers protection at each of the Community Associations. The salaries are based on a livable fair wage and have provided numerous steady job opportunities for individuals in the region. Community forest workers for the Kulera Program follow Standard Operating Procedures for worker safety in the field. Safety procedures help reduce risk of forest workers. The program is based on equal employment rights for all employees, including women, migrants, and underserved minorities.  Eco-tourism is promoted through the project, as the communities are near three protected areas. The program has just started looking into eco-tourism sites for camping and cultural exchange.    SDG 13 Climate Action  The Kulera Program itself is an integrated strategy/plan which increases the governments and community’s ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, foster climate resilience and create healthy communities.  The Kulera Program educates community members on systemic and individual ways to implement adaptation, mitigation and teaches safe technology transfer for reducing deforestation and helping create resilient communities. Communities involved in the program understand climate change, and their role in the program.   The program mobilizes climate finance to fund the on-going program implementation through the monetization of verified emission reductions for climate change mitigation benefits.  Given that the Kulera Program is the largest and most developed REDD+ program in Malawi, it provides valuable capacity building related to operational and technical components for Malawi national REDD+ program.  The Kulera program supports conservation agriculture which helps with soil and water conservation as well as reduced fertilizer inputs. Practices such as mulching, crop residue management, manure management, hedgerows, and agroforestry, as well as the use of improved varieties help crops become more resilient to a changing climate.  Protection of existing forests helps reduce mudslides and floods.    SDG 15 - Life on Land  The Kulera Program protects forests and increase tree cover to improve biodiversity and benefit communities conserve and sustainably use of natural resources.  Activities are fundamentally structured to sustainably manage forests, halt deforestation in the region provide increase tree cover for better livelihoods.   The three protected areas in the Kulera Program are found in the highlands and are some of the last natural forested areas in the region.  Benefit sharing is clearly defined by the Kulera Program where communities are involved in the creation of the program design and how to improve livelihoods through resource conservation. The program is structured to directly transfer the benefits from carbon offset sales into project actions that directly improve the livelihoods and increase opportunities for local stakeholders.   Communities targeted by the program act to end poaching by 1) community patrolling to deter poachers from entering the forest 2) Small-scale livestock production to meet the protein needs of the community 3) surrendering of firearms that would be used for poaching.    SDG 17 - Partnership for Goals  The Kulera Program by its very nature is a partnership between the government and the communities under legally recognized co-management. This is a program that applied legally recognized co-management, which is between the Department of Parks and Wildlife and two large Community Associations, together the protect the forests and build livelihoods of the communities in the buffer zone.   The program covers 700,000 hectares of protected area and 350,000 people and impacts a large number of rural poor communities.  Through the implementation of the program, the partners local and international, government, communities’ associations, private companies and NGOs work together to mobilize and share experiences to achieve sustainable development.  The Community Associations Chairpersons are very much involved at sharing experiences at a national level, providing south-south exchange on informing the Government implementing on the ground.   The Kulera Program is creating business plans to attract private sector engagement that directly support project activities and will be used to gain additional investments 1) wild mushroom production and processing, 2) a honey processing facility, 3) an eco-tourism site.   The Kulera Program has a long partnership with Total LandCare, a local NGO, to procure new technologies such as treadle-pumps and improved crop varieties.   The program is supported by several international companies that have through their carbon neutrality pledges by purchasing verified emission reductions which finance the program.  ","Malawi is one of the poorest counties on earth and the Kulera Communities have been dependent on forest resources, extracting at an unsustainable rate due to the underlying cause of dire poverty. Communities in the area are reliant on rainfed annual agriculture often causing deforestation to grow crops making them susceptible to changing weather patterns and disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. The Kulera Program engages and empowers these communities to be climate resilient by solving issues related to poverty through interventions funded through climate finance. Without climate finance communities will continue to extract resources further causing emissions, deforestation, biodiversity loss and social degradation.     This program has achieved Gold-Level Criteria for Community under the CCB, meaning that it has third-party verified exceptional benefits for communities. Within the communities engaged in the program, specific measures are implemented to verify underrepresented groups are engaged, empowered and have a voice in the program. At each verification a Participatory Rural Appraisal identifies vulnerable and underrepresented groups that are engaged in the program and have access to benefits.   ",,,,,,,,

","The project works with local “ejidos” (communities), and private landowners in order to carry out activities such as preparing the land, planting, working in the greenhouse, processing the biomass and the shipping process. Increasing popularity of bamboo products provides an opportunity for diverse cultures to settle their difference through trade and cooperation that benefits everyone. The project will develop a variety of programs to support these populations, especially the vulnerable groups:  •	Implementing interdisciplinary programs (Alliance with the University of China, Campeche; Student exchanges between Mexico and Canada to promote the transfer of knowledge between the two countries)  •	Sharing sustainability programs and forging partnerships  •	Infusing sustainability throughout the disciplines via staff development offerings and engagement strategies  •	Expanding college/community partnerships and service-learning opportunities for sustainable development (Research and Innovation Center for Bamboo)  •	Building and renovating facilities using socially and environmentally responsible practices  •	Creating socially and environmentally conscious products  •	Mostly women will be employed in the nursery and the greenhouses. Unlike the lumber industry which is both machine-heavy and male-centric, the light weight of bamboo enables women to participate in the bamboo economy, as well as the community’s decisions to favor women for the nursery portion of the program  Ongoing activities include holistic management of relationships with ejidos, communities and local landowners. Celebrating land rental and purchase contracts, recruiting and managing local workers, training local communities to transform bamboo on site, expanding the current nursery and building additional ones, or selling bamboo plants to neighbouring owners, are general activities that we are currently developing in the area. So far, the project participants have been successful in developing relationships with ejidos, local communities, and landowners. A pilot phase included the implementation of interdisciplinary initiatives, the exchange of sustainability programs and the infusion of sustainability in all disciplines through staff development offerings and engagement / partnership strategies (currently projects already provide employment to local members of the community). No fertilizer, pesticides, or herbicides needed. Unlike most cash crops, bamboo requires no agricultural chemicals to thrive. Indeed, this plant sequesters nitrogen and cultivation does not add chemicals to the environment.  Bamboo is the fastest growing grass on the planet. The faster we harvest, the more it grows. Bamboo also does not die in the grass fires that have devastated other reforestation attempts with native hardwoods in the area. Bamboo helps restore the water cycle. The unique rhizome mat of the plant reduces catastrophic flooding and erosion, and also recharges aquifers to mitigate drought. Campeche was selected because it has high and very high levels of soil degradation, caused by agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation, and because it has favorable growing conditions, with abundant water and no frost, and is also home to the Calakmul biosphere. reserve, the largest in Mexico. The lands suffered degradation after many years of broad-spectrum pesticides and other unsustainable practices.  The project participants have also developed a variety of strategic partnerships with local authorities to increase the social and environmental impact of the project:  •	CONAFOR: provides strategic guidance and capital to train local communities in forest management  •	CONAGUA: provides access to funds for water and irrigation infrastructure  •	SADER: to provide strategic guidance and capital to train local communities in forest management and has shown great interest in supporting the production of bamboo products  •	FOCIR and FIRA: to provide institutional capital and guarantees, with the objective of promoting productive projects that favor the development of rural agroindustry in the country.

As a rule, certifications are sought to endorse the sustainability of forest operations and finished products. Proteak has a publicly published Environmental, Social and Occupational Safety and Hygiene Policy, which promotes sustainably managed commercial plantations as an alternative to wood extracted from natural forests.     Some of the operations require the use of machinery and equipment which provoke gaseous pollutants (smog) and particle release. No materials that generate liquid residues that can evaporate will be used, neither solid waste that may decompose and release components into the air. In addition, activities are developed in wide-open areas, where the natural system will have the ability to absorb any impairment caused by the emission of contaminant particles. The same applies to noise. However, within the mitigation measures, only using vehicles and equipment in optimal conditions is proposed.    Actions such as clearing vegetation different from the forest and site preparation have a compensatory effect due to the fact that the generated organic material is deposited in the soil to act as mulch and Proteak has a program at the end of the project plantation which will re-establish the vegetation of the region and improve the vegetation zone. In the medium term, the quality of the landscape will be improved by the establishment of the forest given that the project is located on agricultural land and pasture.    Any effect on wildlife will take place only during the site preparation and establishment of the forest plantation. No significant negative effect is expected. The project activity will generate new niches for wildlife with the development of the trees, such as shelter, new sources of food, and more stable micro climatic conditions.

In the last five years, Proteak has promoted a program to support the community's needs. In 2019, 467 people were supported by this program in three different areas: schools, church, and police facilities, through the different donation types (mainly equipment or construction material).     SDG 4:   Proteak has implemented initiatives that improve employment opportunities for young professionals within its area of influence. This effort includes the generation of skills and abilities required by young people to join the workforce in the forestry industry and associated sectors. The final aim is to formalize continuing education programs with local universities. In 2019, more than 179 students visited the project site and nine training programs were formalized with the universities.

","1. The project employs locals for the development of the activities, who offer additional support to the communities. Additionally, it develops stakeholder consultations with the communities directly affected by the development of the project, with the aim of understanding their concerns and opinions in relation to the project.     The project has diversified the activities of the areas in which it operates, which were primarily focused on the extraction of oil and related extraction services. It has developed an Outgrower Program in the state of Tabasco to include smallholders in the forestry cycle, extending a purchase agreement in advance for the expected wood that will be grown.     2. Social and economic benefits are created through the generation of employment for the development and management of the plantations. The project has also facilitated the construction and maintenance of roads and forest infrastructure.    Additionally, a percentage of the proceeds generated by the sale of VCUs from the previous monitoring period is being used to develop an extensive study to identify the primary needs of the communities in which the company operates. This study will serve as a robust platform for developing specific community programs that address the communities’ needs and develop productive programs around forestry to generate additional revenue streams for them.     3. People from communities close to the project area were interviewed in meetings in order to understand their opinions regarding the project. Different meetings were held according to the plantations' location (states of Nayarit, Chiapas, and Tabasco).

It’s impactful project brings carbon market power to support local landowners.    This project takes place in a portion of Nicaragua that has been almost entirely deforested and converted to farmland as seen in remote analysis.  The reforestation composition is mostly commercial Teak plants, but 10-15% of trees planted consist of endangered native species (such as Honduran Mahogany). A further third of the project is set aside for native forest regeneration.    Nicaforest includes timber harvesting, with the goal to use the timber to absorb carbon for several cycles while allowing the local communities to benefit from their timber. By creating new economic opportunities, the project hopefully jumpstarts a long-term cycle beyond the crediting period.  Long-term timber products are produced from this harvest so the carbon dioxide will be locked for even further years from the atmosphere, but this is not included in the project’s credit issuance for conservative estimates.     The plantations are shown to be successful in remote sensing data, even though many of them are young with only 7-9 years of growth to be observed. Nevertheless, the remote sensing analysis indicates that biomass has climbed since the project’s inception. Additionally, unlike some other harvest projects, there is no evidence of other plantations occurring in the 6 municipalities due to market forces. This suggests high additionality thanks to carbon market access and support.

"Natural Capital Partners Americas, LLC","Natural Capital Partners and the Arbor Day Foundation are two like-minded organizations that have partnered for many years on projects to protect and restore forests. Our collaboration has included the supply of non-market-based forest restoration projects, as well as the sourcing of forestry carbon credits from a wide range of high-quality international nature based projects including REDD+. The unique global reach, market presence and project portfolios of both entities is regularly leveraged to provide the most comprehensive project solutions to our respective clients and corporate partners.     The Arbor Day Foundation is the supplier of CDR credits through the CommuniTree Carbon Program. The Foundation’s specialty is accelerating CDR reforestation and agroforestry projects that create verified carbon credits and forestry-based social enterprises. We also originate innovative forestry carbon credit and value chain portfolios aligned to the Protect, Manage and Restore natural climate solutions framework.    The Arbor Day Foundation is partnering with Taking Root to drive natural climate and livelihood solutions with smallholder farmers. Taking Root is an internationally acclaimed leader in tropical reforestation. As a not for profit, its mission is to grow trees with farmers to tackle poverty and climate change. Taking Root does this by using international funding to create incentives and share knowledge with farmers to make protecting and growing forests a way for farmers to increase their incomes and build sustainable livelihoods.    The Arbor Day Foundation is working with Taking Root to develop and scale their CommuniTree Carbon Program. The focus of the program is on tropical reforestation in Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the Americas.  Nicaragua faces many challenges — one being protecting its forests. Small-scale farming families here are facing significant barriers that prevent them from economically benefitting from planting and maintaining trees on their farms. This leads to a reliance on short-term solutions that are detrimental to the environment as well as the long-term success of their farms. Farmers are clearing forests for cattle grazing and immediate agricultural need because there is no incentive to invest in reforestation or protect current forest areas.    The aim of this collaboration is to change this pattern. Together, we are helping to build financial security and sustainable livelihoods by reforesting previously underused and degraded land. These forests create valuable new sources of income for rural communities including verified carbon credits, local forest enterprises, and agroforestry products such as coffee. Beyond supporting the local community, these forests contain rich biodiversity, supporting more than 100 native tree species, tropical birds, and numerous ground animals. This program is empowering communities while establishing thriving, biodiverse habitats designed to store  carbon. By leveraging Taking Root’s unique technology, Farm-Trace (https://app.farm-trace.com/en/Communitree/), this project provides unparalleled transparency into its environmental and social impacts.    The proposed project aligns to the Foundation’s Guiding Principles for Forest Restoration and meets our quality requirements for additionality and permanence.    Guiding Principles for Investments in Forest Restoration   The Arbor Day Foundation seeks and welcomes diverse partnerships. We believe that alignment with our mission, vision, and core values leads to successful projects and outcomes. Beyond this, we use four guiding principles to identify high-quality and credible partnerships for our work in forest restoration.    •	Act with character and integrity. We ensure that our work and the work of our partners supports our mission, vision, and core values.   •	Plant the right tree, at the right time, in the right place, for the right purpose. Then, grow a diverse and native forest with proven forest resiliency and forest management plans.   •	Respect, empower and benefit local people and communities. We promote equity and collaboration to secure the long-term success of our projects and our people.   •	Align to science-based frameworks and goals. Forested landscapes need protection, better management, and restoration. In addition to making high-quality and high-integrity forestry investments, humanity must reduce greenhouse gas emissions rapidly to stabilize the climate.     Our General Position on Additionality and Permanence   The Arbor Day Foundation brand is grounded in our definitions and track-record of elevating reforestation efforts that meet our standards of quality including both clear additionality and permanence. Forests are dynamic, our values are not.       Our Theory on Additionality   •	We focus on restoring degraded lands where trees and forests are an ecologically appropriately intervention.  •	A future forested state would not be achieved without our intervention.   •	This intervention enhances or restores a native ecosystem.   •	This forest was affected by a natural or human-caused disturbance and will not naturally regenerate.   •	There is not a compliance or regulatory requirement for our forest restoration projects.   •	Measurable new co-benefits such as carbon removed, biodiversity enhanced, watersheds improved, and new landholder revenues generated.   •	If prescribing to the above points, Afforestation/Reforestation projects will have low leakage risk.    Our Theory on Permanence   •	Our goal is to plant and maintain enough trees to result in a thriving, sustained forest, not that every tree survives; rather, that a forest is created, and ecosystem services are enhanced.    •	Collaboration and buy-in from local communities and people is essential.   •	Three to five years is typically a turning point towards long-term project success.  •	Monitoring of seedling survivability is ongoing and reporting is available in our project implementation costs.    •	All the projects we support have ongoing forest management plans.  •	If diversified financial incentives exist to keep forests as forests, these forests are more likely to remain.  •	Assess the political risks that exist in the project jurisdiction.  •	Permanence differs by forest location, landowner type, project-level pressures, and methodology.    ","Reforesting Nicaragua: Regenerating forest ecosystems with smallholder farmers","The CommuniTree Carbon Program","www.takingroot.org https://www.arborday.org/carbon/project-taking-root.cfm ",,"The CommuniTree Carbon program is an award winning carbon project and has become the largest reforestation initiative in Nicaragua. Working with farming families across the Northwest of Nicaragua, the project helps them to grow forests on under used farmland which was historically deforested. Typically, the farmland is owned by family farmers themselves, with the average farm around 2 hectares in size. The project is built around putting the needs of the farmers it works with first, helping them grow native tree species and build forest-based enterprises in order to create sustainable livelihoods for the long term. These forests are creating financial resilience for over 2,500 farming families traditionally earning only $2 a day, regenerating biodiverse habitats across over 6,000 hectares, and storing over 890,000 tonnes of CO2.  The project combines a community first approach with forest science and cutting-edge technologies. The project team is made up of cross-disciplinary local and international experts in forestry, business, smallholder economics, computer science and remote sensing. With over a decade of delivering successful outcomes, their work has been showcased and used as a best-practice reforestation model by organizations including the UN, EU and Mesoamerican Alliance of Peoples and Forests.      As a co-funder of the project’s tree planting and carbon credit offtake activities, the Arbor Day Foundation has planted 275,000 trees and co-originated and 50,000 metric tons of carbon credits to-date.    Microsoft’s payments for the proposed future years CDR new supply will help to grow the project from incremental growth to transformative, scalable expansion. The payments will be used to recruit more farmers to the program and fund operations to reforest more land with them. At least 60% of Microsoft’s payments will be delivered directly to the farmers and their communities in the form of cash and material payments to incentivise them to reforest their land. The majority of the other 40% will be put towards project running costs such as local staffing, farmer visits and training and all the necessary materials needed to operate the project successfully. As well as delivering a natural climate solution, Microsoft’s payments will help the program to scale and expand across Nicaragua, helping thousands of farmers to diversify their income and build resilience in the face of climate change.

Using a combination of field data, satellite imagery and localized machine learning algorithms, FARM-TRACE creates a near real time dashboard of the program’s performance. This dashboard is used to make informed management decisions and to report results to third parties. You can see the impacts of Taking Root’s Nicaragua program here: https://app.farm-trace.com/en/communitree  Through FARM-TRACE, Taking Root monitors and reports all carbon removals and reversals using three interrelated approaches.    1)	Expert site visits: Each farmer within the program is assigned to a local field technician who is responsible for overseeing that farm’s success over time. This field technician visits each farm to evaluate underperforming areas, coach the farmer on how to fix these issues and report each visit including a geo-tagged photo using the FARM-TRACE mobile app. When online, this data is synced to the FARM-TRACE web platform to track how often each farm is being visited, its challenges and progress towards addressing those challenges. The frequency of these visits starts off at 17 visits per year in the first year and progressively declines in frequency as the trees grow and the farmer becomes more experienced.    2)	Carbon inventories: The second approach is based on systematic field measurements that report the inventory of carbon sequestered within the trees grown on farms. The field measurements are done within randomly located sampling plots that cover 10% of the area of every farm. Within these sampling plots, all the trees are measured and entered into the FARM-TRACE mobile app. When online, the mobile app is synced to the FARM-TRACE web platform and forestry and carbon statistics are calculated using the most comprehensive database of pan-tropical biomass equations published in the academic literature (collated by Taking Root), which convert tree measurements into carbon estimates for the farm. These field measurements are performed the first year a farm is planted and at least every five years thereafter.    3)	Remote sensing: The third approach to measuring carbon removals and reversals uses satellite imagery interpreted using a localized machine learning algorithm through the FARM-TRACE platform. These satellite images are acquired over every farm monthly and interpreted to calculate carbon based on relationships that are created using the field measurements.     As well as its continuous impact tracking through FARM-TRACE, Taking Root provides an annual report each year which is reviewed by Plan Vivo before the issuance credits each year. In each annual report any reversals are reported. In addition, every 5 years the program is audited by an external third party to ensure reporting is accurate and the programme is delivering its claimed impacts. The program was last audited in 2016 by Rainforest Alliance and not only passed but were given an award for best practice monitoring practices the year before https://takingroot.org/2015/08/monitoring-award-from-rainforest-alliance/. The next external audit is due next year in 2021.    The following recourses are used in the event of premature reversals.   1)	Program design: The program is designed to take into account reversals before they have happened by reforesting more land each year than required to generate the carbon credits which have been sold.  This means in most cases, actual reversals on individual farms are less than what was planned so no real reversal takes place.     2)	Farm replacements: Taking Root replaces failed farms with entirely new farms at its own expense to make up for losses at the farm level. This is in part possible because Taking Root holds a special fund designated for farmer payments based on success over time. When failures occur, the money earmarked for future payments can be re-deployed to new farms.    3)	Pool risk buffer: Every year Taking Root delivers 15% of its credits generated for that year into a Plan Vivo pool risk buffer. All Plan Vivo projects around the world contribute to this buffer and can call upon it. If there is a shortfall in one project, it can be compensated for through credits generated by other Plan Vivo projects around the world.  ","No","No, the project will not be certified by June 2021 (please specify)","The CommuniTree Carbon Project is certified with Plan Vivo. The CDR credits offered by June 2021 will all be Plan Vivo certified.  Plan Vivo is on a path to being an ICROA approved standard. The CDR credits offered by June 2021 will most likely not be ICROA certified. Depending on the Plan Vivo standard enhancements developed with ICROA there may be a scenario in which these credits can be ICROA approved retroactively.  Once a Plan Vivo ICROA approved standard is put forward, it will be possible to set out a pathway for future ICROA approved CDR credits outlined in this proposal to be delivered. Or, there is the possibility of starting a new project on an ICROA approved standard for the future year CDR volumes (3 million metric tons).

SDG 1 – No Poverty  Up to 2019 Taking Root has delivered over $2.1 million worth of payments for ecosystem services directly into the hands of 855 farming families earning on average less than $2 a day. These payments are recorded by field technicians and audited as part of Taking Root’s finances.    SDG 4 – Quality Education  Taking Root has delivered over 30,000 capacity building workshops to farming families and their communities, providing education and training in best practice sustainable farming and helping farmers to improve their market access. These workshops and activities with farmers are recorded by Taking Root’s field technicians using FARM-TRACE.    SDG 5 – Gender Equality  In Nicaragua farmers are typically men. It is hard for women farmers to get the support they need to succeed. The project works directly with around 300 women farmers, giving them the support to overcome traditional barriers to success. In addition equality is practiced throughout the Taking Root organization with over 50% of the local and international team made up of women, many of whom are in management positions.     SDG 8 – Decent work and Economic Growth  A large impact the project has is on non-landowning farmers. Typically these are some of the poorest and most vulnerable communities. The project creates around 2,000 seasonal jobs a year, helping this population to increase their incomes by helping with project activities such as local seed collection, nursery building and tree planting on farms.    SDG 12 – Responsible consumption and production  By connecting farmers’ reforestation products to markets, responsible consumption and production is being driven at a local an international level. For example, Taking Root has just become the only legally recognised entity allowed to sell firewood. This means over time, all firewood within the region will be coming from a sustainable source. Other products, such as the green coffee grown as part of agroforestry systems is also sold internationally, not only providing additional income to farmers but helping consumers to consume in a way which encourages tropical reforestation.    SDG 13 – Climate Action  The project has reforested over 6,000 hectares of land in the last 10 years and is the largest reforestation initiative in Nicaragua. These activities will result in over 1 million tons of CO2 being removed from the atmosphere.    SDG 15 – Life on land  The project only uses native tree species, with over 100 different native tree species recorded on reforested land. Having planted over 6 million trees, they are recreating local ecosystems and biodiverse habitats.    SDG 17 – Partnership for the goals  As well as working extremely closely with each of the communities which participate in the project, Taking Root has fostered exceptional working relationships with local, national and international partners to build a project which delivers against local and national goals while having a track record of successful impacts with farmers over the last decade.   ","The CommuniTree Program works almost entirely with marginalized groups, smallholder farmers in Nicaragua. Not only is Nicaragua the poorest country in Latin America, the smallholders they work with are in some of the poorest areas of the country. Within these groups, Taking Root works with two particularly marginalized sub-groups to reduce inequalities and promote social inclusion.   1.	Landless farmers; farmers that depend on other farmers who own land for employment during peak times of the year. Taking Root supports them through the creation of around 2,000 seasonal jobs annually during the off-season through activities such as seed collection, pruning trees or weeding to remove competing weeds.   2.	Youth: Taking Root engages with farmers’ children through muralism and educational partnerships so that they are included in conversation with their parents about their future, the role of trees on farming and the climate. Muralism is a local cultural form of storytelling, creating imagery which not only connects the youth to their cultural heritage but promotes messaging regarding the connection between trees and the environment. Educational partnerships are also formed with other schools from around the world where youth are matched to exchange on the role and value of trees and their impact on the global and local environment. One of the reasons many of the farmers grow trees is to create something they can pass on to their children. Working with youth closes the circle so that the forests connect the community and are passed on for years to come.     For all farmers who reforest land within the program, the forests provide a host of benefits including helping them to adapt and build resilience to climate change. In particular, due to climate change farmers are at increased risk of losing crops essential to their livelihoods due to flooding and droughts caused by more extreme weather. The trees farmers grow with Taking Root provide a number of adaptation benefits including:  1)	Help to increase water storage and soil protection on farms, regulating crops’ water supply in the event of droughts and avoiding soil runoff and nutrient loss during periods of high rainfall.    2)	Providing farmers with multiple new products which diversify their incomes beyond their current crops and livestock so there is less reliance on a small number of at risk income streams  3)	Actively benefiting crops grown on farms. For example, coffee farmers in Nicaragua are extremely susceptible to climate change with 90% of Nicaragua’s coffee growing areas predicted to be negatively affected by 2050 due to rising temperatures (Läderach et al). Taking Root is working with over 500 coffee farmers to grow shade trees on their farms, helping to decrease on-farm temperatures from 2-6 degrees Celsius , preventing large yield declines and helping the farmers build resilience for the long term.

Specifically, whilst the entire Niger Delta mangrove belt covers about 190,000 hectares, we propose to begin with a pilot in the Stubb’s Creek Forest Reserve (SCFR), the only mangrove forest reserve in Nigeria. We are ready to organize planting of up to 100,000 new mangrove trees in four local government areas covering 200 hectares of lowland rainforest and mangrove swamp forest. This can be done in a year, with project expansion and mangrove restoration into other areas within Akwa Ibom state achieved annually thereafter, with a target of 1,0000,000 native trees planted.    Informal consultations have been held to sensitise the target communities and acquire invaluable knowledge about current customs and essential needs.

A project management team and a 15-member management committee have been established to leverage the expertise and knowledge of multiple local NGOs and institutions.  Land ownership is joint with both state government and local community stakes. The management rights are owned by the State government. As a result, both the state government and the communities will be joint operators and beneficiaries of the blue carbon project.  Whilst private and public funding to cover community education and capacity building exists, the project needs additional funding to purchase and nurture the seedlings and distribute improved cookstoves.

The unique Niger Delta mangrove ecosystem is on the verge of being totally lost. Mangrove forests are converted to farmlands and the trees are cut for timber, fuel, and house construction. In fact, until recently, SCFR represented the only remaining natural coastal swamp forest of any significant size.   In order to achieve successful, long-lasting mangrove conservation, it is therefore imperative to take community livelihoods into consideration and the project intends to align with the country’s “Poverty Reduction Strategy” which supports improving local resource management as a key element of poverty reduction. As such, the project would improve methods and technologies that support the sustainable use of biological resources, promote livelihood alternatives among key mangrove dependents, ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits for poverty reduction, enhance biodiversity management capability through education and awareness among the communities, and promote adoption of fuel-efficient biomass cookstoves in other to reduce the rate of mangrove exploitation for fuelwood.    Sustainable resource use will ensure the continuous availability of timber and non-timber products. The timber products are used by the furniture and building industry, while non-timber forest products (NTFPs) include medicinal herbs and pharmaceutical products used locally to treat certain ailments. Other NTFPs like tannin, dyes, gum, resin, ropes, wild fruits, and leaves can be collected by the marginal forest-dependent people to sell in the local markets.  ",,,,,,,,

The Carbon Trust estimates that floating wind can reach 70 GW of installed capacity by 2040, with a project value of GBP 195 billion. In addition, up to 10.7 GW are expected to be feasible by 2030.    This initiative, spearheaded by Iberdrola and backed by an international consortium, will be rolled out at the Met Centre in Norway to help reduce the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) to a range of €40-60/MWh by 2030, driven by economies of scale, competitive supply chains and a variety of technological innovations.    Iberdrola, with its technical expertise together with Microsoft, with its vision, could contribute to the deployment of innovative renewable technologies that will help to avoid CO2 emissions helping to pave the deployment of future floating wind farms.    The Flagship project plans to develop a 10 MW floating offshore wind turbine and a semi-submersible floating concrete structure. Both elements will be designed to operate in North Sea conditions and will pave the way for future 500 MW floating wind farms. The project is also an opportunity to test the feasibility of installing them in other locations in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Pacific, and to study the cost and logistical viability of using concrete technology instead of steel.    Flagship was submitted to a call for tenders announced by the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) with the aim of assessing and funding innovative floating wind farm technology. An assessment gave the project full marks (15 out of 15), it was among 14 other proposals.    The INEA has invited Iberdrola and its partners to begin preparations for a funding agreement which, if successfully concluded, would be signed with an approximately €25 million grant for the consortium.

It works to take degraded land, which was often deforested for cattle grazing, and restore it with forest ecosystems. This forest carbon project tries to uniquely create a sustainable and scalable forest solution that will ensure protection of the forest for years even after the project ends.    Particularly, the project has three main goals: (1) conserve the forest that is there already, (2) reforest native species in ravines and hard to reach areas, and (3) forest timber plantations and create livelihoods. A small subset of the project is also devoted to cacao agroforestry. By creating a mixture of both natural land protection and sustainable timber production, the project seeks to create long-term landscape change while providing employment to local communities.    Of the timber forests, the species being planted represent a mixture of native species and non-native teak, with teak making up approximately 55 % of the plantings. The remaining 45% consist of 13 different native species. These forests are also FSC certified and follow sustainable practices set-out under those guidelines. The Tropical Mix project is a grouped project, with various land units joining the project over time. However, the oldest land portions show considerable biomass growth and productivity in Pachama’s remote sensing analysis.    Although the project only receives carbon credit for reforestation activities, the project has considerable environmental benefits in the fact that it is conserving the existing forests. Conserved areas represent approximately 36% of the project area.        The project consists of many farms spread across Panama that are privately owned by three participating companies Eco Cebaco S.A., Forest Finance S.A., Sustainable Timbers S.A. This group certification allows more stakeholders to benefit from carbon revenue, as the individual organizations would not have the resources or capacity to achieve the demanding certification with Gold Standard. The credit payments will go to CO2OL as the project developer to support final verification. Proceeds are split between CO2OL with these landowners according to carbon sequestered.

The project has promoted know-how, incrementing capacity building and being a key element for socio-economic development.    A key element is building the capacity to grow and manage forestry and agroforestry areas in changing climatic condition. For Land Use based activities, climate change adaptation to maintain sustainable productivity is just as important on a local micro-level as the project’s contributions to limit climate change globally. This is one of the reasons why active forest management beyond carbon crediting periods is so crucial.

In the case of carbon performance shortfalls or premature reversals, the project will compensate the equivalent number of Verified Emission Reductions (VERs) in accordance with the Gold Standard guidelines – including measures to retire active VERs from the same project as a replacement, plant additional areas, or access the compliance buffer for permanence (like all forestry projects, CO2OL Tropical Mix contributes 20% of its carbon inventory to the compliance buffer pool – a reserve in cases where carbon is no longer sequestered due to an event such as forest burning or unplanned clearing, and can’t be compensated by active measures within the project.).

Digital technologies, including drone monitoring and remote sensing, will ensure a rigorous inventory in the long term.    Thus, an important factor regarding carbon performance is related to the monitoring system. Initially, all information from the sample field plots was saved in different Excel tables, and different formats were used to keep the information. Since 2014, the local team has stored all the field data in one central software system (Mirasliv). This enables the project to manage the data more efficiently and store all data in a standardized format. Quality control and assurance are part of the standard process for monitoring, as well as for the different certifications – including internal reviews as well as third-party auditors.   Field data is correlated with literature data describing and adjusted to the site locations on regional, national and international tiers. All values and results are conservative and applicable to the project site and management practice. Furthermore, the software helps the project to keep the data updated. It provides accurate values and notifications of possible changes. Making use of forest monitoring software and the GIS database for all the projects will guarantee the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) and allow the project to provide the most accurate information regarding carbon performance.  These inputs and monitoring approaches allow the project developers to identify reversals in biomass and carbon stocks and, in most cases, prevent them before the fact, e.g. via interventions in early stages of disease. Any losses can thus be replaced in due course via reforestation and overall forest management.

It can also be noted that the project areas were selected because of their disuse prior to joining the carbon project, in order to ensure that activities such as cattle farming would not be displaced to other areas, thus avoiding indirect deforestation.  -        Other areas were selected due to reforestation having been identified relatively shortly beforehand. These areas were purchased by the local project implementers in order to reverse this trend and prevent the areas from remaining permanently deforested.    In addition, the project’s integration into local structures and livelihood creation is significant. Measures including improvements to housing infrastructure, subsistence activities, education, the healthcare system and the purchase of basic needs help to prevent an unintended leakage effect.    In order to achieve the intended effects, a careful analysis of individual areas and their previous use is crucial. Especially in a project such as CO2OL Tropical Mix – which has been adding new areas and planting more trees for almost two decades – the constant verification of leakage issues by independent auditors is not only relevant for transparency, but also in order to constantly receive objective feedback.

The standard requires projects to demonstrate a clear and direct contribution to at least three SDGs. CO2OL Tropical Mix was certified with a contribution to five SDGs. The following indicators were used to quantify and measure the SDG impact:     ?        SDG1: No Poverty – End poverty in all its forms everywhere  - Number of local communities or people who benefited from the project's investments   - Measured impact: economic and impact extent. Five local communities or 1,000 people benefited directly and indirectly  ?        SDG8: Decent Work and Economic Growth – Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all  - Employment generated due to project activity and development  - Number of training sessions or workshops provided to the employees  - Measured impact: more than 150 people employed, working on average 40 hours per week, and at least one training session per year conducted (training 150 employees)  ?        SDG12: Responsible Consumption and Production – Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns   - Percentage of timber volume verified and certified by FSC, and percentage of cocoa volume certified by UTZ in selected areas of the project   - Measured impact: around 8.32 m3/year/ha volume of sustainable timber, with timber sales up to 1025 m3, and 34 tons of cocoa verified and certified by the Gold Standard, FSC and UTZ  ?

The project is managed by a multicultural and diverse team, including workers and representatives from local communities. Project proponents conducted stakeholder consultations to ensure the inclusion of diverse local stakeholders and seek their opinion on a regular basis.    The owners of the land as well as the recipients of the carbon finance are the project’s local implementation partners, who participate in a group certification approach administered by ForestFinest Consulting. The group certification allows more stakeholders to benefit from carbon revenue, as the individual organisations would not have the resources or capacity to achieve the demanding certification with Gold Standard for the Global Goals. Each participating organization receives the payment for carbon credits based on their carbon storage performance. The carbon model identifies the carbon stock in each management unit and thus the respective carbon credit generation. Local communities participate in the form of employment, infrastructure, training, social programs, etc. but don’t receive direct carbon credit revenue.    As one of its main rules, the project will not employ any personnel on the basis of their gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation: the constitution of the host country prohibits discrimination based on a person's race, sex, religion, place of birth, disability, political affiliation or social status. These rules are in place to ensure the engagement and empowerment of diversified project participants at all levels.    2. Climate justice issues are very closely related to the project, which is located in a developing country within rural low-income vulnerable communities. The minimum wage in the project regions is USD 265.20 a month (40 hours). This is a very challenging situation for the local communities who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The Gold Standard certification documents that the project contributes to the SDG1: No poverty through quantitative employment and income generation.     The project experience revealed how the reforestation and agroforestry activities established in different low-income rural areas can be an effective support in alleviating regional poverty, promoting know-how, and incrementally building capacity, and they can be a key element in socio-economic development, by providing jobs directly and indirectly.    A key element in this is building the capacity to grow and manage forestry and agroforestry areas in changing climatic conditions. For land-use-based activities, adaptation to climate change to maintain sustainable productivity on a local, micro level is just as important as the project’s contributions to limiting climate change globally. This is one of the reasons why active forest management beyond carbon crediting periods is so crucial: even when carbon finance comes to an end, major benefits will remain as a result of sustainably managed, robust, and productive ecosystems that are permanently monitored, adapted and improved – lessening the burden of increasingly challenging climactic conditions for livelihoods in rural low-income communities.    3. The project works with local communities to improve their livelihoods in a sustainable manner. The main social benefits for the communities of the project are:  a) Poverty alleviation: many people in rural areas are forced to migrate to the cities due to the lack of regional job opportunities.  b) Equal rights: the company has a multicultural team and a mix of people with equal rights without gender discrimination.  c) Capacity building: the employees and neighbours are continuously learning about the importance and significance of sustainable activities, and the importance of climate change mitigation.  d) The transition to a just and sustainable future is a long process and requires constant effort and engagement. The permanence of the project focuses not only on the crediting period but also on the local situation once the project ends. Through diversified activities to engaging local communities to build sustainable livelihoods, the ultimate goal is to manage the forest in a sustainable way in the future, with community members acting as forest guardians.

The Project addresses widespread deforestation caused by the expansion of agriculture due to international demand, degraded lands and low farmer income. The San Martin region is the most degraded region of Peru and is being deforested at a rate of 67,000ha/year. A root cause of this deforestation is the cycle of poverty that forces farmers to make the choice between forest conservation and family income.     This project realizes that agricultural production does not need to degrade ecosystems and can instead regenerate them. Jubilacion Segura, which means secure and happy retirement, supports farmers to develop diversified agroforestry systems and restore degraded lands through afforestation.     PUR Projet is the Project designer and manages the CDR monitoring and evaluation, farmers participate through their cooperatives or local organizations in the promotion of the development of co-products value chain, the securing of land tenure, and the national and international recognition of their contribution. Reforested areas are the farmers’ land (average farm size 1ha/farmer) Land-use before reforestation can be perennial crops (cocoa, coffee, orange, etc.), annual crops (corn, rice, etc.), abandoned land or land in rotations with annual crops (“purmas”), pastures. The reforested zones are located outside of any conservation area have not been deforested over the past 10 years and does not fall under the definition of forests.     Since 2010, PUR Projet has supported over 2,600 farmers to restore 2,671 ha of land and plant over 1.6 million trees. This Project is certified under the Voluntary Carbon Standard and timber harvesting is certified under the Forestry Stewardship Council Certification. Trees planted support CDR, and there is a plan to plant 150,000 trees per year until 2040.  Not included in this project, but adjacent, is a 300,000 ha conservation project that PUR Projet manages.

While 80% of farmers do have formal documentation recognizing their rights to the land, there is still a risk with the 20% of farmers farm without formal documentation. To mitigate the risk and increase even the project’s benefits to the farmers, the project has initiated a land titling process called CUSAF (Cesion en Uso para Sistemas Agroforestales). As a first step, a contract was signed in 2011 between Acopagro and the Titling department of San Martin Regional Government (ex-COFOPRI) for the prioritization of land titling for the farmers in the area of influence of the project in San Martin. As a result of this ongoing process, several thousand land titles were registered between 2013 and 2018 in the project area.

Working with several Indigenous Communities, the project has teamed up with one tribe (Buktamaco) to replicate their experience in obtaining land title recognition, so that several tribes can participate in the program    Working with a large number of small farmers, ClimateCare's  partners have worked out ""templates"" for typical planting scenarios that collectively will be meaningful. For illustration, the 2020 planting campaign will include a handful of poultry farmers who are required to maintain a bio-security perimeter around their poultry operations - this however does not prevent bamboo planting. There are 170 poultry farmers on standby to replicate the 2020 planting pilot. We address our intention to share carbon dividends with participating planters, by bringing hectare-level biomass and tonnage down to a single bamboo clump. This means that we are able to engage with both larger farmers or indigenous populations, but also small farmers so that they can participate even if their individual planting is measured in ""bamboo clumps"" not hectares (typically 200 bamboo clumps per hectare).    The Philippines in general and the island of Mindanao in particular has the unenvious distinction of being ground zero for climate impact in Southeast Asia.  Each year, Mindanao suffers from both droughts and flooding. This is the result of 5 decades of legal and illegal logging that has reduced Mindanao's forests by an average of 100,000 hectares per year.     Regarding droughts, there are two impacts of developing a bamboo economy: one is to extend the availability of water (because bamboo culms act as natural ""water bank accounts"" that absorb up to 70% of the water when it rains and gradually releases this water content as the soil dries. The second is disaster resilience to fire.  Fires take a toll on Mindanao farmers every summer. Bamboo is the only plant that, even if fully destroyed above ground, immediately recovers and regrows from its underground root system.     Regarding flooding: the biggest impact in Mindanao is as a result of landslides - bamboo's root system forms a net (by connecting with other clumps underground) thereby providing a natural protection against soil erosion.    It is the very essence and raison d'etre of this project to bring the disenfranchised population of Mindanao into the green economy. While Mindanao's population comprises 20 million of Philippines' 80 million, Mindanao has 1/3 of Philippines' population at the poverty level and experiencing a range of health conditions associated with hunger. Within Mindanao, the Indigenous populations are by far the worse off with little opportunity to travel to urban centers for work. For these reasons, this project prioritizes creating income opportunities across the entire bamboo value chain - from nursery development to planting and down the road developing cottage industries by optimizing all parts of the bamboo plant's material output.  Despite having land tenure for over 40% of the island of Mindanao (the size of Ireland), this land ownership does not translate into economic benefits because indigenous populations have not been able to access traditional finance (banks require collateral and they cannot use their land as collateral).  By providing income across the bamboo value chain, and providing technical and administrative support, we can help indigenous communities enter the mainstream of economic activity, earning not only wages as laborers, but becoming fully-fledged participants in the bamboo economy.

This is an ambitious peatland restoration project in the Scottish Flow Country, an area that represents the largest blanket bog in Europe. Scottish peat is estimated to hold around 1,620 Mt of carbon, and the Flow Country is the common name for the vast peatland blankets of Caithness and Sutherland – mainland Scotland’s most northern counties. In partnership with ClimateCare, the project will initially aim to restore up to 1200ha of degraded peat, with an estimated cumulative total of 200,000 tCO2e. The intention is to continue to restore an additional 3500ha of degraded peat across the rest of the estate.       The IUCN Peatland Code recognises the cumulative tCO2e as emission reductions rather the CDR. So for that reason, the removal percentage of this project must currently be represented as such (see Question 14).     By blocking artificial drainage ditches, rewetting will be encouraged, and water levels will rise. This in turn prevents the loss of carbon as carbon dioxide and encourages?Sphagnum?mosses to re-establish, creating new peat and sequestering more carbon dioxide.      This project has extremely deep peat with up to 10 metre in places, but has suffered significant degradation over many years, a trend that the landowner is determined to reverse with the help pf carbon finance.      Carbon finance will be used to support the cost of the restoration process. This includes the physical blocking of artificial drainage ditches that were traditionally dug to improve grazing conditions for livestock and game. Process will include constructing dams, blocking gulleys with stone and heather brash, a technique known as grip blocking. Over large-scale areas helicopters are used to aid the process. With the rewetting process and water levels rising, bare peat may also be covered with heather brash, and reseeded with Sphagnum moss to encourage revegetation and the creation of peat soil.      The land is part of Dunbeath & Glutt Estates which have been around since 14th century, overlooking the Moray Firth in NE Scotland. The Estates stretching to some 45,000 acres along the coast and backing inland onto the fabled Flow Country, the largest repository of carbon in peat bogs in the Norther Hemisphere.

Water catchment: in the UK, 70% of all drinking water is derived from surface water, which comes predominantly from upland often peat-dominated catchments. Re-vegetation on this project will reduce/stop surface erosion within 3-4 years, and thereby minimise discharge of sediment and particulate organic carbon export into flows. Grip blocking will reduce extreme peak flows and the associated discharge, developing longer water retention. ","eatland management in the UK has focussed for many years on drying the land out, for commercial forestry, with the planting of vast swathes of unsuitable fast growing non-native species, and for sport, with the burning of the peat to encourage ground nesting birds.      The restoration of these areas can now provide an alternative form of land use, diversifying income streams for landowners, and encouraging the land to be valued as a carbon sink.      in the absence of the project, local people will continue to view agriculture, forestry, and sport as the only use for peatlands.

The regional government has the expertise of provincial forestry technicians who provide key support and authorizations/approvals to our planting designs and ensure the quality of the plantings adhere to the highest quality standards. These forestry departments are also the ones responsible for forest fire prevention, detection and emergency response. Since 2018, we have been working with the Junta to restore over 2,000 hectares of land and we have direct line of sight on thousands of hectares for the upcoming years.    Nursery (seedling production) and Planting crews: We procure seedlings and/or seeds from local nurseries to make sure we work with native species and local provenances. For both seedling production and planting machinery/execution on this specific site, we work with El Ejidillo Viveros Integrales, a contractor chosen from a select list of providers with decades of experience in the sector and a production capacity of 8 million seedlings per year. Being one of their largest customers and offering them continuity in their operations, we are in a unique position to jointly bring down costs and introduce innovative nursery techniques, while testing the impact of such changes over the lifetime of the trees.    Land Life Company assesses each site and designs a technical planting plan, which we share with the contractors, who are responsible for delivering on the planting execution, within budget and deadline. Their crews have a fore(wo)man present on-site every day. We also employ our own field supervisors who go into the field several times a week to ensure the planting is meeting our high quality standards and following  the specifications in the technical plan, while providing employment to the local population.     Materials: We procure tree protectors from a large supplier, as well as produce protectors within our own internal research and development team. Based on our planting results collected over the years, we apply different protection methods to lower the risk of seedlings suffering from desiccating winds, wild animals or harsh winter weather, while minimizing cost of the planting.    Others: We work with prominent experts in health and safety coordination to carry out independent auditing on our projects and contractors, in order to make sure the preventive measures are in place to minimize work hazards with heavy machinery and in rough outdoor conditions.

Maintenance over the first four years is overseen by Land Life Company, and then it is transferred to regional authorities and protected according to the national and regional laws for Montes de Utilidad Pública. Land Life Company regularly monitors our planted forests, using ground-based monitoring tools (e.g. a Land Life Company developed app) and remote sensing by drone or satellite imagery, which is all captured in a global database. Microsoft’s CDR payment, net of funding costs, will recover the costs incurred during planting and MRV.     The Pisón project is a small part of Land Life Company’s Spain reforestation program that includes restoring ~1,150 hectares by planting 1.1 million trees in the 2020/2021 planting season. The objective of these projects is to restore:   1) Degraded formal pasture land, typically left idle and no longer productive  2) Forests lost to wildfire, typically cleared but left barren with limited natural regeneration  3) Abandoned agricultural land with depleted soils that nature cannot regenerate on its own  4) Degraded animal habitat or migration corridors (at national parks).

Mitigation starts at the site selection phase. Not just in Spain but globally, we only select and work on sites with solid legal protection and where landowners/partners (like the Spanish Junta) have mandates and competencies to protect and maintain these lands in perpetuity. Such commitment is made contractually explicitly in the land access/management agreement.     At the design phase, we introduce native, biodiverse and climate change resilient species in our planting design, often co-determined with our local partners in order to meet/elevate the desired restoration impact. A typical Land Life Company planting commonly has 8 to 15 different native species, where layouts and species mixes are further refined at the sub-plot level to reduce the likelihood of fire, pests or disease spreading.    After planting, we monitor our projects frequently using technologies - starting with in-field monitoring by our own app when the seedlings are young and increasingly use drone and satellite images as the trees grow older and bigger. We’ve also developed early-warning systems to flag (a)biotic stresses such as animal and fire risks for our local operations team or partners.     Of course the reversal risks can never be fully eliminated. To manage that commercially, we model and verify our captures scientifically and make commercial commitments accordingly. Our model reflects actual planting design as input, builds in natural mortality rates, simulates not one but hundreds to thousands of potential pathways and takes a risk buffer (withholding from available volumes) just like other VCS-registered projects. Above that, for this opportunity we reserve another 10% of expected net capture for potential recourse for reversal. Further short-fall/reversal, depending on the nature, could be managed contractually - either as recourse or force majeure.

The first option is verification under VCS - which maintains a list of accredited auditors capable of verifying the project’s impact per relevant standard requirements. Land Life Company has prepared a draft VCS Project Description of selective past plantings, which is being reviewed by an independent third party. This draft PD, while not concerning the volumes offered to Microsoft, can shed light on the verification details and is available upon request.    The second pathway is to verify by emerging, technology-empowered assessments, which leverages remote sensing by drone or satellite and shows promise in reducing verification speed, interval and costs. We are aware of and engaging with such potential third parties, but have not yet tested such verification approach in practice. We are open to any such potential candidates, especially those already vetted by Microsoft - so long as the technology is accurate and the approach and outcome can be made transparent.   ","Reforestation in Pisón will help rebuild the environment, wildlife and biodiversity of the area. It is an area where grazing has over the centuries removed the natural vegetation and depleted the soil in terms of nutrients and water holding capacity. It will also give a second life to this land, which is so important to the local community.     The reforestation of Pisón will take place on government-protected land, limiting the risk of deforestation. The law clearly states it is illegal to cut down trees on this land. Furthermore, the potential causes of deforestation, primarily for grazing, are no longer relevant at this site.     We have investigated the risk of leakage and have concluded that leakage by a replacement of livestock to locations outside the project boundary is highly unlikely for the plantation sites of this proposal for the following five reasons (including sourcing):    1) The surroundings of the plantation sites are hotspots of land abandonment in Europe (based on Lasanta, T et al. 2016. “Space-Time Process and Drivers of Land Abandonment in Europe.”)    2) The site characteristics are such that the key-drivers of land abandonment are locally operational,    3) Livestock is steadily decreasing in Spain ( Sepuru, Terrence Koena, and Timothy Dube. 2018. “An Appraisal on the Progress of Remote Sensing Applications in Soil Erosion Mapping and Monitoring.” Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment TA  - TT  - 9: 1–9.  FAO Agricultural Production Indices)    4) The region shifting its priorities and focus away from traditional agriculture (EU information on Castilla y León - Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship And Smes)    5) Future assessment indicates ongoing land abandonment (Perpiña Castillo,, Eloína Coll Aliaga, Carlo Lavalle, and José Carlos Martínez Llario. 2020. “An Assessment and Spatial Modelling of Agricultural Land Abandonment in Spain (2015–2030).” Sustainability 12(2): 560. https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/2/560 (July 14, 2020))    Limited amounts of fossil fuels will be used in the reforestation of Pisón. Machinery is used for land/soil preparation, land assessment and planting design and transport of people to the planting site. Emissions, while marginal are nonetheless subtracted from all gross capture figures. Furthermore, Land Life Company is investing in developing an autonomous, lightweight electric planting vehicle to ensure that operations emit as little CO2 as possible and cause the least environmental disruption as possible.   ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","Yes","Trees, when planted with the right species mix in the right place, are one of nature’s most effective and holistic climate solutions. Trees remove CO2 from the air, restore soil, increase water retention, provide animal habitat, enhance biodiversity, provide shade and cooling, and enhance the overall wellbeing for the surrounding communities. The reforestation of Pisón can be expected to holistically contribute to the following United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG's):     SDG 8 - Decent work & Economic Development: Reforestation stimulates the local economy both in terms of labor and procurement. The planting of this small reforestation project alone will procure 37,000 seedlings from local nurseries and create approximately 95 labor-days of employment. Additionally, the technology focus of a Land Life Company project creates high quality, highly skilled jobs. Forest engineers, agronomists, operations managers, skilled CAD operators are required in the field, with data scientists, and software engineers being employed in the office to compute and analyze the data. Furthermore, reforestation of degraded land also makes land healthy, productive and valuable again.     SDG 13 - Climate Action: There is no greater tool than a tree to take CO2 out of the atmosphere over time, creating crucial organic carbon sinks required to meet our global climate goals. As the reforestation scale accumulates, it can have a cooling effect as well as potentially increase rainfall overtime. Its impact is similarly felt on the ground as reforestation prevents erosion and reverses the loss of topsoil.    SDG 15 - Life on Land: Reforestation is a critical tool to rebuild habitat and biodiversity lost to wildfire, overfarming and urbanization. The associated increase in biodiversity can be measured based on the evolution of species mix over time. In particular, a focus on including the right share of pollinating species and fruit-bearing species within a planting can significantly accelerate the regeneration of an ecosystem through reforestation. ","In general, as Land Life Company focuses specifically on restoring degraded lands, all of its projects address the disproportionate impacts of climate change on low-income communities. Our sites range from refugee camps to rural Europe to the borderlands of the U.S. and Mexico. No matter the location, our approach is consistently to engage, train and employ people in these communities. We have employed and worked alongside refugees, AmeriCorps volunteers, students, inmates and veterans, learning as much as we have shared.     Spain specifically is a stark example of the social, climate and ecological challenges Europe faces today. Over 10 million hectares of land in Spain are degraded, making it the largest man-made desert in Europe. Aging population and rapid rural depopulation has left 61% of Spanish municipalities with less than 1,000 inhabitants and 20% of the rural population in Spain is made up of people over the age of 85. With 75% of all the farmers in Spain retiring in the next 10 years and further pressure from urbanization, Spain’s rural landscapes are vulnerable to even further degradation or abandonment. A recent study by The Lancet estimates that Spain’s population will halve by the year 2100, and it is reasonable to assume that this population loss will hit hardest in rural areas.    Northern Spain presents substantial opportunities for reforestation and creating climate, social and environmental impact. Land Life Company’s largest European reforestation hub, Castilla y León, is a Spanish autonomous region twice the size of the Netherlands, but with a population of only 2.4 million that is aging and declining and 4th lowest median income level across 17 autonomous regions.      Land Life Company seeks to impact communities and ecosystems by creating multi-benefit projects on protected land, which can help local communities. Our work helps protect rural communities from the high risk of forest fires on abandoned land, which is exacerbated by extreme weather conditions due to climate change (e.g., weed growth where trees do not naturally regenerate, soil erosion).     Our plantings also provide a wider range of ecosystem services that are seen as valuable to the municipalities, such as: many use this land for mushroom harvest, apiculture, fruit/berry production, hunting and agrotourism. Lastly, planting in these areas injects income in these rural economies, from seed collection, seedling production, to planting labor and maintenance.  ",,,,,,,,
"Biorecro AB","Söderenergi and associated partners.","Negative Emissions with BECCS in Igelsta","N/A","Not yet available",,"The project is located at a combined heat and power plant in Igelsta, south of Stockholm, Sweden. The plant delivers 2500 GWh of heat and 550 GWh of electricity each year to the inhabitants and industries (including an AstraZeneca production facility) in the vicinity. The fuel used for the production of heat and power consists of residue materials from the Swedish forest and timber industry and is, by consequence, of organic origin. At present, the carbon dioxide resulting from this process is released into the atmosphere. The amount of negative emissions that could be produced at Igelstaverket is estimated to around 650 000 metric tons per year.     The Igelsta project is in the planning phase, with a feasibility study to begin in autumn 2020. Once the study is complete, Söderenergi and Biorecro intend to move forward with further planning, FEED studies, construction and operations. The intended start date for the first deliveries of negative emissions is during the first half of 2026.    The carbon capture will be performed on the flue gas exhaust from the main combustion process. After condensation and compression of the carbon dioxide, it can be stored and shipped conveniently since the Igelsta plant has its own harbor. The carbon dioxide will be transported and injected at an injection site in the North Sea, where it will be permanently stored in bedrock layers more than 1000 meters below the surface. Once operational, an estimated 650 000 metric tons of carbon dioxide will be removed from the atmosphere each year.

The electrical energy needed for the production of the negative emissions will be generated by the Igelsta plant itself. Thereby, it will not have fossil emissions apart from a small fraction of industrial plastics that may be present in the fuel mix. To this the GHG-emissions from transport and injection must also be added.     There are a few other concerns that should be addressed.    Sustainable biomass sourcing. The main concern with the Biorecro BECCS design relates to the underlying biomass sourcing, as is the case for all biomass energy systems. There are several biomass cultivation regions that already today are cultivated in a way that allows for both net carbon uptake and a high biomass yield. The Swedish forestry system is a good example, since it produces an annual yield equivalent to 100 million metric tons of CO2 in wood, pulp and energy products, as well as acting as a carbon sink for another 20-50 million metric tons of CO2 (Karlsson et al. 2018). The Igelsta plant is an already existing industrial facility operating on a sustainable bioenergy fuel source and will not require any additional use of biomass to produce negative emissions.    Political risks including conflicting agendas and public opinion. Carbon removal techniques and negative emissions have rather surprisingly been met with a generous amount of skepticism, something that has severely affected development at all levels. As BECCS is widely seen as a key carbon removal technology (e.g. IPCC AR5, 2014), the technology has been made the target of general skepticism towards negative emissions technologies. Therefore, a risk associated with any negative emissions project is that public opinion and/or political agendas may affect successful deployment and timelines. In this specific project, the partners are mitigating this risk by applying a high level of stakeholder involvement already in the pre-study phase.  ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","Yes","Adding production of negative emissions to an already existing industrial plant, the infrastructure and all adjacent systems (roads, harbor, industrial buildings etc.) will attain a higher level of use, leading to shorter payback time scale for the underlying investments. Thus it strongly supports SDG #9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation). It is also contributing to SDG #8 (Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all) by providing employment opportunities in the region.","This project focuses on adding a new process to an existing heat and power plant in Sweden, i.e. not in a low-income community or a developing country. If successful, the same process might very well be developed on a heat and power plant in the specified areas. At this stage however, this is not within the scope of this specific project.",,,,,,,,

Avoided decomposing of biomass: To make biochar we use agricultural biomass residue from grain production, which would in normal case be composted or burnt. Those emissions are avoided by stabilizing the carbon in the residue into our biochar for hundreds of years. 230 kg of CO2eq per mt ton biomass residue is avoided.  2.	Replacement of materials and their emissions: Use of Biochar can displace use of fertilizer, water filters or building materials that would have caused emissions.  3.	Yield increase impacts: When biochar is used in substrates or soil improvements for horticulture in greenhouses or agriculture, 10% yield increases have been reported. More crops and products means also that less land is required for producing the same amount of food or that more food can be grown on the existing farm land and greenhouses.  4.	Green jobs: manufacturing biochar creates green jobs thorough out the value chain from harvesting to distribution and use.  5.	Increased water retention lowers the need for irrigation of crops. The irrigation generates excess water in the atmosphere and has a GHG effect. This is lowered by using biochar in agricultural soils.  6.	Short-lived impact on albedo: Biochar when applied to farmlands needs to be plowed down into the soil. This is typically done when normal tillage is carried out and the land is already “black”. It can decrease the albedo effect (reflectivity) slightly. However, this is typically a short period ( day of spreading). It is always in the economic interest of the farmer to have the biochar deep down into the soil as fast as possible.","The biochar will be placed in poor soils in Southern Sweden and strengthen the farmers climate resilience and lower the risk for rural areas in terms of securing future food supply and jobs and livelihood.",,,,,,,,

To fulfill these goals, the OKPN team is looking to strengthen its business plan and financial sustainability on the long term. The issuance and sale of Verified Emission Reductions have the capacity to provide a long-term financial sustainability.    South Pole Carbon Asset Management is partnering with African Parks for the development of the REDD+ project at OKNP. South Pole performs the preparation of the forestry project under the voluntary carbon market for GHG mitigation, defining aspects as additionality, compliance with existing laws (including revision of NDC of the studied country), community and biodiversity benefits generated by the project, identification of potential negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts and mitigation measures, identification of non-permanence risks (internal, external and natural), determination and estimation of baseline emissions, estimate of GHG emissions in the project scenario and the specific parameters to be monitored for the MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) as well as ongoing verifications over a time period of 10 years. South Pole is also coordinating with African Parks to approach corporate organizations to secure a long-term offtake agreement for carbon credits expected from the Odzala project.

The implementation of the project in this protected area will contribute to reducing poaching activities and will allow the forest cover to remain stable by avoiding the conversion from natural forest to alternative uses. This will safeguard the biodiversity in Odzala that will be impacted positively through the protection of natural habitat and the reduction of anthropogenic disturbances (forest fragmentation and illegal fuelwood harvesting), resulting in enhanced forest cover and an increase in habitat availability for local fauna, and improving ecosystem resilience and the provision of ecosystem services.     Moreover, the main social and economic benefits derived from the project are guaranteeing food security by creating new productive and economic opportunities in the community, as well as livelihoods for locals and better access to employment. Over 200 local people are employed by Odzala, with part of the commercial revenue generated by the park allocated towards community development. Alternative livelihood programs are also being considered for the periphery of the park, including the development of farming projects such as banana and cocoa plantations. These projects are designed to stimulate economic opportunity for local people and reduce the poaching pressure on the park. The benefits mentioned above are directly related to the SDGs, specifically SDG 2 ‘Zero Hunger’, SDG 12 ‘Responsible Consumption and Production’, SDG 13 ‘Climate Action’ and SDG 15 ‘Life on Land’, among others.

The project aims to ensure a transition to an economy free of deforestation and forest wildlife degradation by guaranteeing food security and creating sustainable productive alternatives for local communities.    The OKNP has identified around 130,000 people living in the periphery of the park, who live off the natural resources provided by their direct environment. Of these,10,000 people now have a direct influence on management decisions concerning Odzala as a result of the Odzala-Kokoua Foundation, which has two local community representatives on its board.

"Clean Air Action Corporation","N/A","Reforestation and sustainable development project led by subsistence farmers","The TIST Program in Uganda","https://program.tist.org/",,"Subsistence farmers participating in The International Small Group and Tree Planting (""TIST"") Program combat poverty, deforestation, and climate change by improving their farms and planting trees. Through focused training, leadership development, and sharing of Best Practices, Small Groups of 6-12 TIST farmers develop tools to responsibly and sustainably care for their local environment, local biodiversity, the global climate, and the health and well-being of their families and communities.     Since 1999, TIST farmers have identified the local challenges they face and develop locally appropriate practices to address them. Through these practices, TIST farmers generate over $8 of CCBA Verified value for every tree planted, in the form of increased shade, stream bed stability, reduced soil erosion, windbreaks, firewood, medicine, fruits, nuts, and other tangible benefits. TIST's rotating approach to leadership means that women are active leaders at all levels of the Program. Although few women in Uganda have 'title deed' to land, almost 40% of the TIST participants in Uganda are women, while both employees and management are 50% women. To support this gender parity, TIST uses a Payment for Environmental Services (PES) model that does not require land ownership, only demonstrated access to the trees on the land. This system supports full participation by women and youth.     To join the TIST Program, each Small Group signs a contract with CAAC for a term of 60 years, agreeing to plant and maintain TIST trees. CAAC has developed innovative procedures for monitoring, quantifying, and tabulating the carbon stocks in the TIST trees. In simplified terms, CAAC-trained TIST Quantifiers visit each grove (a privately-owned land where tree planting occurs, usually a smallholder farm) approximately once every 18 months, to count trees and collect tree circumference, GPS location, and other data. Each TIST Quantifier is audited both in the field and on the computer. Once the data is collected, the TIST Quantifiers transmit the data via a specially designed smartphone app to the TIST database, where it is managed by CAAC and publicly available for review online.     TIST's award-winning monitoring system also records the TIST farmers' progress to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals, advancing at least 12 of the SDGs.     Microsoft's payments for CDR would fund TIST farmers' tree planting activities, training opportunities, and the monetization of the carbon stocks. 70% of the profit from Microsoft's CDR payments would go directly to the TIST farmers.

Normal, nature-based risks associated with forestry (fires, insects, droughts, etc.) are dramatically less for TIST because of the small, disparate tree groves owned by TIST farmers. Tiny tracts of land owned by subsistence farmers are not at risk of land seizure. The project is distributed across large areas of each operational country. TIST has verified the minimum risk rating in each of the program's VCS PDs.      TIST contracts with farmers for 60 years, during which time they agree to maintain the tree groves they have planted on their properties. In addition to the contractual obligation, TIST provides on-going sustainable development training that encourages the long-term maintenance of the trees. Farmers are incentivized to maintain the trees because, so far, they have received over $8 in monetized benefits per tree, exceeding any of the carbon benefits from the trees. However, with a strong sales price to Microsoft, the profit share to the farmers' increases, providing a further incentive to maintain the trees on their farms and replace them as they die.     TIST monitors all of its trees and project areas approximately every 18 months. During the monitoring, all trees in a project area are counted, and a statistically significant number are measured. This information is used to determine the cumulative biomass and carbon removals.  It is compared to the amount removed during the prior monitoring periods, so that the net change in removal can be established. A gain becomes new credits. A loss would mean a reversal.  Because TIST has multiple PDs and is growing all the time, TIST can mitigate any reversals.    All of the credits to be sold to Microsoft are verified under Verra's VCS standard. As an A/R project, we, and all other A/R projects, have been placing at least 10% of our credits into a buffer account to guarantee against loss or reversals.    ","Yes","Not applicable (I answered yes to Q24)",,,,"Verra (VCS)",,,"Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCB)",,,"We do not believe there will be any negative environmental impact. TIST farmers are planting trees on their own land, using manual labor, and are trained to make compost and use natural fertilizers. TIST owns no vehicles; all travel is done using public transportation. There are no fossil fuel inputs.      By planting on their own land, TIST farmers are offsetting the need to deforest natural forests.  They can use their trees to provide a sustainable fuel supply by pruning and using wood from natural mortality and forestry thinning.      TIST has seven verified CCB projects where we demonstrate the above. Attached is an example that is under verification right now. Attachments: Monitoring reports for 005 and 009.    TIST also creates meaningful landscape benefits for the surrounding communities.

By virtue of being verified as CCB Gold for Exceptional Community Benefits, the TIST Program has demonstrated significant measurable co-benefits. The CCB surveys consist of in-depth interviews with a subset of TIST farmers that measure participant livelihoods through five main types of capital, including social, human, financial, physical, and natural. Results from these CCB surveys of TIST farmers show that participants experience a range of economic benefits and positive social impacts, regardless of socioeconomic status or gender. The most important benefits and impacts were sales and savings from tree products such as fruits, nuts, and firewood sales and use of tree seedlings, increases in crop yield due to Conservation Farming methods, increased social support and leadership skills, and increased knowledge and use of preventative health measures. In fact, TIST farmers generate over $8 of CCBA Verified value for every tree planted.    The TIST Program is currently quantifying impacts on 12 Sustainable Development Goals (""SDGs"") and tracking its impact on all 17 SDGs. Because of its robust monitoring system, the Program was selected to pilot new strategies for quantifying SDG impacts with Verra's SDVista standard. As with the CCB verification, many of the SDG metrics are obtained from surveys conducted by the TIST program. The surveys were conducted in a semi-structured environment, by teams of experienced local TIST volunteers, across a range of clusters and geographies.    Monitoring is done periodically as part of the overall monitoring of TIST. TIST Quantifiers collect data as they visit each Small Group to count trees by species and count fuel-efficient stoves. Trainers collect training information at meetings, which include the subjects covered and the quantity of people attending.     TIST's approach to program organization and project management also supports the local community. Small Groups form the foundational blocks of TIST, facilitating the exchange of Best Practices and maximizing accountability on a local level. Certain Best Practices support the Small Groups' success, including rotating leadership between men and women, weekly meetings, preventing one person from dominating the discussion, accepting viewpoints without criticism, and identifying Best Practices specific to the environment of the Small Group.    Finally, researchers at the University of Exeter have detected a greening effect from TIST, using remote sensing. These landscape effects represent a benefit to the surrounding community beyond just the participating TIST farmers.  ","The TIST Program was formed by and for subsistence farmers who experience disproportionate impacts of climate change, ranging from inadequate food supplies and fuel sources to degraded land and irregular weather patterns. TIST farmers are fighting back by planting trees and improving their farms by practicing conservation farming. CAAC acts as a bridge between these subsistence farmers and the carbon markets, channeling substantial carbon financing to these low-income communities in the form of prepayments and 70% profit sharing.    The TIST Program is structured to eliminate economic and social barriers to participation.  Anyone can join TIST at no cost. Carbon payments are made using a Payment for Environmental Services (PES) model that does not require land ownership. This system supports full participation by women and youth. Those with neither land, nor access to land, can still receive TIST training, materials, and resources for free.    At the local, regional, and national levels, TIST achieves gender parity in leadership roles. Through the practice of rotational leadership, new Cluster leaders are elected to serve 4-month terms, alternating by gender. This develops local leadership capacity and identifies promising female leaders. Each country is managed by a gender-equal cohort of people from that country. CAAC does not employ any expatriates in its operating countries.     Instead, TIST employees and contractors are men and women working within their communities. The Program draws upon a diverse group of trainers and Quantifiers that come from across various tribes, religious groups, ethnic groups, language groups, and geographies. These workers are an accurate reflection of the diverse groups found within TIST's 93,000+ participants.    Ugandans run the TIST- Uganda Program. The 60-plus TIST Quantifiers are TIST farmers trained to monitor, quantify, and tabulate the carbon stocks in the TIST trees. We do not have formal education requirements for any position. Those that have proven they can do the job are the ones doing the job. And we ensure access to develop skills by holding regular training seminars for Quantifiers and conducting regular audits to make sure their skills are honed.  Our CCB monitoring reports demonstrate the monetized benefits received by the marginalized participants.  ",,,,,,,,

It harbors the greatest variety and concentration of primates found anywhere in East Africa and is home to at least 350 tree species. Prior to being established as a National Park in 1993, Kibale was a Forest Reserve. The northern portion of the park was degraded due to the valuable timber species located there, and southern sections were heavily encroached upon by local inhabitants. The UWA is responsible for the management of Uganda’s National Parks. Face the Future, together with UWA, launched a carbon sequestration project in the southern part of the park. The project focuses on the restoration of natural forest using native tree species and fire control methods. The major barrier to the natural regeneration of the forest is the growth of elephant grass, which restricts sapling growth. The elephant grass is therefore first cut manually before planting the saplings. Tending and weeding activities are carried out to establish well-adapted tree plantations in a cost-effective manner.    The project aims to impart forestry skills and knowledge to the local communities to make them environmental ambassadors of the project.

The people employed by the project are especially those from impoverished communities living along the boundary of the project area. Most of the people rely on a combination of subsistence agriculture and market crops for their livelihood. The income from daily labor at the project is crucial to enabling communities to make their own investments in school fees for their children, in housing, and in small businesses. The advantage of working for the project is also that it can be combined with work on their own farms, based on the complementary practices and flexible/shorter working hours. ",,,,,,,,

Environmental Defenders (ED) is an NGO in the biodiverse Lake Albert region of Uganda, working to protect environmental resources and human rights.  To solve problems of land degradation and threats of unsustainable land use, ED purchases land for reforestation, including 450 acres (182 ha) they currently own, with a goal of continuing to secure additional land each year.  They have established two tree nursery beds, producing 1000-2500 seedlings/year, and successfully reforested 75 acres (30 ha).  Their role in this project is to provide land, act as the on-the-ground Project Proponent for production of VCS Verified Carbon Units, and purchase Terraformation technology needed to scale up and monitor forests.     Terraformation is a critical partner to enable rapid scaling up of reforestation, and our role is to act as Project Proponent to produce and represent VCS Verified Carbon Units for sale on the global marketplace.  TF will arrange independent carbon credit verification services for this project, and will provide ED a 100% solar-powered seed bank module (addressing the current bottleneck of limited seed supply), 100% solar-powered nursery module and water catchment infrastructure (to dramatically increase propagation), fine-scale plant and remote landscape monitoring technology, and expert training and support in all our novel forest technology to ensure successful reforestation outcomes.

Operational inefficiencies and losses   2. Illegal incursions and logging  3. Land use and titling risks    Re: operational monitoring  Terraformation and Environmental Defenders use Terraformation’s proprietary forestry and carbon monitoring software system, Terraware, for aggregation of forestry data collected via smartphone, drones, and satellites to help us meet or exceed certification/verification standards.  This monitoring system will enable us and our project partners to intervene as quickly as possible during reversal events or when other threats to project success appear.      Re: illegal logging  ED employs one security guard and a field team who monitor sites for illegal logging activities or other (i.e. natural) events that pose a threat to the unintended reversals.  ED is a local, community organization involving many persons, including volunteers.  This on-the-ground presence is key for the involvement and acceptance of a project locally and increases “ownership” with the project through trust and personal relationships.    Re: land use and title issues   The Albertine Region of Uganda hosts on-going commercial oil and gas exploration projects.   ED was founded specifically to protect vulnerable natural areas from such unsustainable activities in perpetuity, and land purchase, conservation, and reforestation are the best ways to achieve this.  Terraformation is providing a grant of $100,000 to ED to support the project and build capacity.  ED will use $10,000 to complete the legal process of inspecting and titling its lands, which gives additional protection and legal security to land owners, e.g., if developers were to try and purchase ED’s lands.     Should a reversal appear from any of the risk factors discussed above or others, compensation is provided by a “pooled buffer account” across VCS verified projects which serves as an “insurance” towards unintended release of carbon dioxide.","No","No, the project will not be certified by June 2021 (please specify)","We anticipate project verification to be completed by January 2022.",,,,,"None",,"We have identified the following project related emissions:  Scope 1: 17.20 mt CO2e  Scope 2: 14.38 mt CO2e  Scope 3: 107.17 mt CO2e  Total: 138.75 metric tons (mt) CO2e    Our emission estimation includes fuel for various small machinery that is used for nursery operation, and transportation of persons and equipment/plants to planting sites; and emissions from purchased electricity that is used by staff to complete project related office tasks/to power electrical equipment.

This project supports most SDGs and directly aligns with the following SDGs:    GOAL 1: NO POVERTY – This project promotes economic growth, which is inclusive to under-resourced communities in Uganda, will provide sustainable jobs, and promotes equality.  GOAL 7: AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY – Terraformation provides 100% renewable energy solutions for forestry, promoting sustainability of this project.  GOAL 9: INDUSTRY, INNOVATION, AND INFRASTRUCTURE – Through Terraformation’s forestry innovations, investments in infrastructure contribute directly to sustainable development.  GOAL 13: CLIMATE ACTION – Terraformation’s mission is to use robust, affordable forest technology to solve climate change through natural carbon capture.  GOAL 15: LIFE ON LAND – Environmental Defenders and Terraformation will collaborate to sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss in Uganda’s Lake Albert Region.  GOAL 17: PARTNERSHIPS – Central to Terraformation’s mission is a strong commitment to developing equitable, inclusive, global partnerships for sustainable development.    The project will improve the organizational capacity of Environmental Defenders to pursue its mission of protecting areas of critical importance for the conservation of endemic and threatened plant species in Uganda.  This will be done through capacity building for staff and volunteers in project management, project development, monitoring, and evaluation.    It will also raise visibility of ED, empowering them to garner matching support as they expand.  Sales of carbon will provide income to ED, improving financial security for long-term environmental conservation, land acquisitions, environmental education, and operations.     Nursery establishment and production of seedlings will provide additional income to ED through sales of seedlings to farmers, government, NGOs, and other organizations.  The project also supports other income-generating activities within the reforested areas, e.g., bee keeping and shea nut oil production.  This project will create jobs and employ local Indigenous people, combating poverty in this under-resourced community.    This project also directly supports Uganda's National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan II (NBSAP; of which ED is a signatory) for implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in line with the SDGs.  The plan reports that Uganda’s forestry sector contributes about 6% of the national GDP and employs over a million people; additionally, forestry supports livelihoods, making up 11-27% of household cash incomes in communities near forest reserves.     Beyond income generation, the project will focus on reducing deforestation pressures on nearby communities.  In addition to carbon sequestration, the project has co-benefits of improved environmental services such as improved water retention, decreased water runoff leading to decreased soil erosion, soil stabilization in areas prone to mudslides, and improved soil nutrients.  It will also lead to improved land use planning and ecosystem-based climate change adaptation plans for local communities.     Uganda’s NBSAP reports that forestry’s contribution to soil/water management and carbon sequestration is valued at over US $130.7 million annually.  Importantly, the project will also build local capacity and develop unique carbon management systems that may be replicated in other communities throughout the country and will spread organically over the continent.    Biodiversity co-benefits will be derived from the planting of indigenous species that support a variety of insects and small mammals, improved watersheds, increased soil productivity, and increased resilience to climate change.  This will lead to improved conservation of Uganda’s native trees, tree diversity, and forest coverage, reducing pressure on natural resources outside government protected areas.  This project also supports improved management of Key Biodiversity Areas, Endemic Bird Areas, Important Bird Areas, World Heritage Sites, Biodiversity Hotspots, and Biosphere Reserves; and the Uganda NBSAP’s first priority area: restoration of degraded ecosystems.  ","Our project empowers Environmental Defenders (ED), located in the remote, rural Lake Albert region of Uganda in East Africa.  Despite their success in obtaining small grants, they have faced systemic barriers to accessing carbon finance and other forms of funding due to their geographic location within a developing country, small size of their organization, and staff members’ limited access to technical training and education.  Rural communities in this region of Africa exemplify vulnerable, low-income, under-resourced communities being disproportionately affected by climate change.  ED has ambitious goals to lead the charge in Sub-Saharan Africa’s transition to climate sustainability – we just need to empower them.    In addition to reforestation and carbon sequestration, ED is dedicated to helping marginalized Indigenous communities make a sustainable living and protect their water sources and local environment, preserving indigenous trees and cultural ways of life.  Conservation activities also include preservation of Indigenous Knowledge of African medicinal plants used by ancestors, and providing local farmers with seedlings of traditional fruit and timber trees.     By supplying trees to community partners, they have facilitated reforestation (beyond their own land) of 60 acres (24 ha) of a farmers group’s land, 40 acres (16 ha) of National Forest Authority land in Luli Kayonga Central Forest Reserve, and other local farmers’ land with trees provided by ED.  Revenue generated from sales of carbon will also be re-invested in community development to improve education of indigenous and rural communities in the Lake Albert region through scholarships to disadvantaged children, provision of clean and safe water for communities, and livelihood support in the form of village loan and savings associations.    Environmental Defenders’ long-term goal is to serve as a conservation education and seed storage hub for all of Sub-Saharan Africa.  They would like to meet the needs of neighboring countries including Kenya, South Sudan, DR Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, and other countries that would be interested in learning and adopting ED’s tree conservation approach in their own regions.     They also want to preserve understory herbs used in traditional medicine, as well as varieties of grasses used for constructing traditional houses, all of which are declining in recent times due to human activities such as bushfires and large-scale commercial activity expansion.  All these aspects of their work will help ensure that underrepresented and under-resourced communities are not left behind in the transition to an environmentally just future.  ",,,,,,,,

The area has been heavily deforested for decades and plantations of exotic species harmful for natural ecosystems, such as eucalyptus or pine trees, have been promoted over the last 30 years. As a result of deforestation, farmers are now affected by excessive temperatures, land erosion and degradation and longer dry periods with less water.  Despite cocoa, coffee and vanilla crops thriving in shade conditions, most farmers who grow these crops do not have shade-trees on their farms. Additionally, coffee farmers often lack knowledge on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) that promote agroforestry and could substantially increase yields and income.     Since 2015, the project has been engaging farmer members of the Rwenzori Farmers Cooperative Union (RFCU), an organization that gathers 14 primary cooperatives from the districts of Kasese, Kabarole, Ntoroko and Bundibugyo in the Rwenzori region and collects and sells vanilla, coffee and cocoa. The project intends to promote sustainable agroforestry design and Good Agricultural Practice training, in partnership with the RFCU, by directly supporting agroforestry and coffee technicians from the cooperatives to provide technical assistance and share education with farmers. In the coming months, the project will design and manage the carbon certification process, leveraging the project participants’ expertise from other VCS and Gold Standard certified projects.      As of August 2020, farmers from these cooperatives have been supported to plant 450,000 trees and over 1,300 farmers have received Good Agricultural Practice trainings. The project expects a very high survival rate of trees (>90%) and beneficiary engagement. In February 2020, education and awareness events were hosted about halting deforestation, which engaged 20,000 community members in the region, which continued to raise awareness of the potential of agroforestry.

The woodlands will offer diverse additional local benefits, including natural flood management, biodiversity gain, public access, support for employment. All projects are designed in collaboration with local forestry experts, subject to local consultation, and follow the rules of the UK Forest Standard to ensure appropriate and diversified species, biodiversity enhancement and appropriate adjustments for water courses, sites of scientific interest, and so on.     The projects are certified under the UK government Woodland Carbon Code, via independent and accredited audit. All projects will be subject to ongoing and long-term monitoring under the Code.

As an example, one of the projects in the portfolio is at Rottal. Sitting right on the southern edge of the Cairngorms National Park, this new woodland is scenically situated within the upper catchment of the River South Esk. As such, the project has been designed with riparian and conservation objectives in mind. New planting will establish native trees on the banks of the South Esk and another local tributary. These will, in time, shade the water courses and help to mitigate the effects of climate change on Atlantic Salmon and the endangered Freshwater Pearl Mussel, both of which are sensitive to increases in water temperature. In addition, the new trees’ roots will help to bind the soil, reducing erosion and stabilizing the riverbanks after heavy rain events.  Beyond the riparian benefits, this new woodland will also help terrestrial biodiversity  and, with its blend of native and productive trees, provide some timber income for the estate through continuous canopy cover management – the creation of an all age forest through gradual thinning, replanting and no clear-felling.

This project aims to build off of the City’s forthcoming Urban Forest Strategic Plan by focusing on restoring high-priority degraded natural areas. By working with the city and select private landowners to develop new planting on underserved land, Cambium’s goal is to deliver carbon sequestration by addressing the most vulnerable neighborhoods and scalable near-term opportunities. This pilot will set the stage for a significant number of shovel-ready, high co-benefit carbon offsetting projects over the next 10 years by supporting the first Reforestation Hub.     Planting projects will take place on a) a subsection of the Parks Department’s 10,000 acres of public natural lands, with a focus on those areas at risk of massive canopy loss by 2040, and b) select large private landowners whose properties will yield outsized carbon and community benefits.     History of project: Philadelphia lost over 1000 acres of urban tree canopy in the past decade - about 6% of its total. The city just launched a 10-year campaign to reverse this trend, and is hoping Cambium Carbon will help it tackle reforestation efforts in its managed natural areas. Within the broader goal of returning the City to 30% tree cover, this project looks to develop its first planting pilot in Spring 2021.

(Locke et al, preprint, 2020)      This leads disadvantaged neighborhoods to lose out on a whole host of benefits that urban forests bestow resiliency on a community: reduced urban heat island effect, enhanced stormwater management, reduced air pollution - the list of environmental and public health benefits is numerous. It also robs these communities of what Cambium Carbon sees as an economic opportunity in urban wood economies, which could help place marginalized workers in local lumber mill and nursery jobs that cannot be outsourced.      This is particularly important in Philadelphia, which ranks 2nd among large US cities in the percentage of residents living below the poverty line (24.5%).

Eichelman et al. 2018 estimate that wetlands require 3.6 acre-feet of water per acre and rice requires 3.2 acre-ft per acre of water.

The Delta provides freshwater to over half of all Californians and 3 million acres of farmland. The ability to supply this water depends on the integrity of levees that imperfectly protect islands from flooding.  The Delta also supports more than 55 fish species and more than 750 plant and wildlife species. Of those, 13 species of fish and 11 wildlife species are threatened and considered special status.     The oxidation of the peat soil has lowered the land surface of most Delta islands. In some areas, the land has sunk more than 25 feet below sea level. (As seen in the photo attached at the end of the survey, tanker ships can now be seen floating above subsided agricultural land.) Delta organic soils are subsiding at rates of between about a quarter of an inch and 1.5 inches per year. The ground is sinking as sea levels gradually rise.     As sea levels rise and the land subsides, levees become increasingly vulnerable to overtopping or breaching. However, raising levees doesn’t prevent the land from sinking, which increases hydrostatic pressure on levees and seepage under levees that can erode levee foundational materials. Since the mid 1970s, almost $1 billion has been spent on maintenance and repair of Delta levees. Since 1950, there have been 87 Delta levee failures and island floods. If multiple Delta levees failed simultaneously, saltwater could invade waterways and sloughs, compromising the essential freshwater supplies for communities, industries, and ecosystems in Northern California, San Francisco Bay areas, San Joaquin Valley, Central Coast, and Southern California. This could cause a significant interruption in water deliveries from the Delta and a significant impact to the state’s economy. Re-wetting the soil stops the subsidence and carbon emissions.

The target properties vary in size from 40 to 1,500 acres and are located in critical—and rapidly developing—lands surrounding Yellowstone National Park and perhaps other environmentally significant areas. A number of species rely on this area for wintering, birthing, migration, etc. This area is also under tremendous subdivision and development pressure. Many small properties are experiencing excessive rest because they have been without any livestock use for years. The larger properties likely need longer rest periods because of impacts from conventional livestock grazing. Either way, this project presents an opportunity to mimic the historic grazing patterns of large herds of wild ungulates roaming freely across the landscape under the influence and pressure of numerous types of predators. These traditional grazing patterns forced the herds to be grouped rather tightly, causing heavy, localized impacts on the plants and soil (grazing, defecation, urination, hoof impact), and frequent movement so grazed areas received sufficient “rest”, which allowed the soil and vegetation to recover. The current landscape under discussion evolved with this historic impact of heavy grazing and rest.    This grazing behavior is opposite of the conventional agriculture model which disperses livestock across large tracts of land where the animals can be very selective with their diet, overgrazing some plants and undergrazing others. The overgrazed species have been grazed out while the undergrazed are decadent and less productive, leaving excessive patches of bare ground and carbon-deprived soil. The program would provide the resources needed to significantly improve the management of these important properties and sequester more carbon.

A carbon removal incentive would not only protect these resources, but also make these operations more profitable, thus less susceptible to development pressure and leasing for oil and gas extraction.    The project would use regenerative grazing practices that preserve ecosystems and the local economies that depend on them. The stewardship of landowners who use these practices positively impacts wildlife, water, and the scenic values that make Montana unique and underpin the recreation and tourism economy.    The project would provide small landowners with tools, information, and financial incentives required to be excellent stewards of their land. These regenerative grazing techniques consistently enhance the integrity of soil, water, and air quality, as well as grassland and riparian health. This has lasting and positive impacts on the abundance and diversity of species that depend upon ranchlands. Regenerative methods also improve the vitality of “ecosystem processes,” such as the water cycle, mineral cycle, energy flow, and biodiversity, while consistently increasing forage for both livestock and wildlife. These techniques also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, equipment, pharmaceuticals, and fuels utilized in traditional grazing methods.    Enhancing the economic viability of landowners through this incentive is important because of the crucial role small landowners play in increasing carbon removals, as well as their role in protecting soil, water and wildlife habitat. Small landowners, and especially ranchers, must be profitable to stay in business, especially in the face of the growth pressure facing our region. Bozeman, Montana was recently ranked as the fastest growing micro-city in the nation with Kalispell coming in at number three.","Smaller landowners have historically been excluded from carbon finance due to economy of scale issues.

The project activity involves spreading a layer of compost on grazed rangelands in Solano County. The compost initiates a series of positive feedback loops that not only increase soil carbon retention and promote atmospheric sequestration, but also improve other factors relating to ecological resilience.         Currently, there are not any CDR compost addition projects that have used an ICROA-approved carbon protocol to generate and issue verified credits. However, according to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, 770 million acres of rangeland in the US alone are ready and awaiting compost applications.

This in turn promotes stronger root growth and healthier soil microbe communities, which in turn encourage more root growth. The results of these positive feedback loops lead to greater water retention, which protects plant communities from being as susceptible to droughts.      - Provides stable, slow-release nutrients: Low-carbon soils do not hold nutrients well, so plants are not able to rely on the nutrients in the soil for sustained growth. Healthy carbon stocks in the soil retain nutrients, allowing those nutrients to be released slowly and absorbed by plants. This leads to improved plant growth and resilience.     - Increases forage production: Simply and obviously put, plants grow better in healthy soil. Compost application leads to healthier soil, which promotes the growth of plants that grazing animals feed upon. Areas of land that have healthy forage material are valuable to ranchers, and thus ranchers will pay a premium to graze their animals on healthy land. Therefore, the increased forage production not only increases the value for the land by sequestering more carbon, but it also improves the value of the land from the perspective of ranchers.     - Creates a viable offtake for compost production: Today, a handful of cities across the U.S. and globally have robust municipal compost systems. As more cities invest in composting infrastructure, this compost will need to have someplace to go to deliver its benefits. Application to rangelands offers the opportunity to absorb massive amounts of compost and put that compost to work in a system that sequesters carbon.       - Serves as a model for agro-economic systems: The project improves producer (on-farm) opportunities to monetize ecosystem services while providing greater access to ecosystem and carbon markets for the Land Trust. It serves as a regional model for regenerative agricultural practices and expands producer capacity to implement these practices through direct outreach and education to the larger ranching and land management community.

The multiple stakeholders of this project make it unique in that all three entities have chosen to work together and put their land in one basket to conserve it and create a viable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) project. Historically, the project area land use has included industrial forestry, conversion to and management for agriculture, and urban/suburban development. Management decisions of the forest focus on sustainable, natural forest growth and non-commercial maintenance harvests to reduce hazards for recreation users, promote forest health, and protect the drinking water supply of the surrounding urban areas. The project activity represents a significant improvement in the carbon storage and conservation value than higher return, more aggressive management regimes of industrial private lands in the region, which are characterized by shorter, even-aged rotations. Without a carbon project, these forest lands very well may have been put into commercial timber harvesting. By committing to maintain forest CO2 stocks above the regional baseline, the project will provide significant CDRs through carbon sequestration.

This carbon can then additionally be used for environmental remediation and further GhG prevention.  The founders Henrietta & Chris met at Nasa Ames, at a 3 month intensive program to focus on solving the world’s current challenges. Chris had worked with an inventor - professor and brought the tech to the table: The “Flash Carbonisation” technology was originally invented in an academic setting, and researched for over a decade in the lab. Carbo Culture was founded to take the science commercial, and to scale the operation. We’ve successfully 8x scaled up in volume, and ran past the university IP now to the stage where we are looking for funding to build our first (profitable!) facility.     Carbo Culture converts biomass waste into stable biocarbons. Waste biomass will decompose into methane (?CH?_4) and carbon dioxide (?CO?_2), leaving only a tiny fraction of carbon into soil if unattended. If the biomass is burned, the emissions are released within the immediate future. By converting the biomass into biocarbon in the high-temperature system, the carbons are converted into a solid state that stays stable for over 1000 years - keeping the carbon away from the atmosphere and at hand for environmental remediation purposes.   Each ton of biochar that we produce sequesters 3.12 tons of ?CO?_2in a stable form. This biocarbon is made by using a safe and scalable TRL 7  demo system in California’s Central Valley.   Our electrochemically conductive biocarbon can enhance natural bacterial processes, help remove toxins, filter water and enhance the resilience of soil, and our unique process can deliver biocarbons with characteristics that are not achievable in standard pyrolysis systems.  Microsoft’s purchase of the biochar / credits will be all used towards our pilot system: producing the high-temp biochar.

For the same reason reversals are not expected in our project, because the verifier checks that the biochar is not shipped to combustive use. Generally accepted durations for biochar are 100-1000 years for biochar.  The durable storage of biochar and the carbon dioxide embodied in it can be estimated with the O:C ration received from the laboratory test. In general, a molar ratio of O:C lower than 0.2 appears to provide, at minimum, a 1000-year biochar half-life. There is a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010), which allows to calculate a duration over which 90% of carbon in the biochar remains.  Puro methodologies always contain a buffer that covers premature reversals of carbon removal. In the biochar methodology the buffer is currently between 2,5 -5% reflecting the scientifically measured quality of the biochar i.e. the O:C ratio.

If Microsoft is interested in this project, ClimateCare and PUR Projet will explore certification options in line with your scientific verification principles.     Regenerative Agriculture encompasses holistic practices that create net beneficial impacts on ecosystem services. This includes improving net carbon sequestration (CDR), improving watershed and soil health and promoting biodiversity habitat. By necessity, these activities must provide net beneficial economic and social impacts for farmers and local communities if they are to be sustainable over the long term.     Regenerative Agriculture practices sequester carbon in above and below ground pools as plants capture CO2 from the air to build their roots, stems, leaves and trunks. Additions of these organic matter inputs to soil can increase the soil organic carbon pool; regenerative practices can also reduce losses of carbon from the soil by decreasing erosion and minimizing soil disturbance.     In the USA, it is estimated that adopting improved management practices can lead to sequestration of atmospheric carbon into soil organic carbon at an annual rate of 45 to 98 Tg in cropland, and 13 to 70 Tg in grazing land (Lal et al., 2003). Over the past year, the project participants have designed a project under the NORI framework to quantify and value below-ground CDR created through the implementation of regenerative practices on farms in the USA.      We are partnered with PUR Projet, who is the project implementer and designer with key local partners, local farmers will be engaged to leverage carbon baseline tools, specifically the COMET-Farm Tool, a whole farm and ranch carbon and greenhouse gas accounting system (developed by the United States Deparnment of Agriculture and Colorado State University), and NORI will be the Platform where the carbon credits are certified and listed.

DU has authored multiple carbon offset standards and maintains the largest grassland carbon offset portfolio in the world at this time. The ability to provide these services all under ‘one roof’ increases our programmatic efficiency, reduces risk of new ventures such as this carbon proposal, and provides a clear communication channel for working landowners; some of whom are hesitant to engage one conservation organization, let alone a larger collaborative. Nonetheless, DU works with several partners in the region to deliver on our mission and will continually assess value-added partnerships for this program, if selected. ","Cropland-to-Working-Grasslands Restoration in the Dakotas of the U.S.","Working Grasslands Restoration","N/A",,"The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of the U.S.—once a mosaic of grasslands and intermittent wetlands—has seen extensive conversion to row-crop agriculture. Largely in private ownership, DU and partners continue to seek ways to promote private lands conservation, while supporting working landscapes and rural communities throughout North and South Dakota.  Many landowners are interested in replanting sensitive cropland acres back to prairie grasslands and utilizing them for grazing and/or haying instead of intensive farming. However, foregoing the income during the first 2-3 years as grasses reestablish is often an insurmountable hurdle to this type of conservation taking place.  Carbon finance from Microsoft could address this critical gap by covering that foregone income to working families and achieve the level of incentive needed, while not taking away from available restoration funding.     Through this partnership, DU will identify high-conservation parcels, engage landowners, secure voluntary landowner agreements and restore cropland back to grasslands. The carbon payments (Microsoft funded) will be used to cover lost income, will be leveraged to raise the restoration funds required, and will help establish clear GHG title. All acres receiving the carbon financing will be required to execute a perpetual conservation easement, for which landowners will be compensated for at fair-market value. The easement will greatly add to the durability of the CDRs and provide a framework for monitoring and enforcement.     We propose utilizing the recent framework developed by Climate Action Reserve (CAR) for reforestation, known as Climate Forward (attached), which credits CDRs on an ex ante basis. This methodology was developed to provide a practical solution to companies seeking mitigation of future emissions, while driving forward-looking investment into actions expected to result in CDR outcomes. This framework addresses the economic realities of most restoration projects, recognizing that carbon payments over the life of the project cannot compensate for the significant upfront financing needs of replanting and waiting for grasses to mature. DU proposes to work with CAR to develop a grassland reestablishment module under the same overarching protocol guidance document. Under this concept, carbon investments are made on the front end when financing is most needed in exchange for the attributable CDRs that occur throughout the life of the project. The benefit for the carbon assets remains the same, but the ability to compensate the landowner up front for the significant start-up costs provides carbon financing that other methods have yet to address.

DU completed a formal risk assessment for our Avoided Grassland Conversion projects in the same geography which concluded (and third-party validated) that such risk was inconsequential. All enrolled acres will be accompanied by a conservation easement with definitive terms against cultivation. These are legal contracts deeded to the land in perpetuity that run with the land across all owners. DU adheres to very strict monitoring and reporting practices outlined by our accreditation as a national land trust by the Land Trust Alliance, and we deal with any violation in a swift and comprehensive manner. If a landowner were to plow up replanted grass, the binding easement would be enforced, and the landowner would be required to replant immediately. While some carbon would be emitted during that reversal event, soil organic carbon is relatively slow to emit and those losses can be regained in a rather short period of time (say, versus the cutting down of trees).     The acreage totals and CDR tons put forth in this proposal are conservative, particularly as it relates to landowner demand. Furthermore, we are already staffed and have willing landowners identified. The primary unknown is the development of the new module standard, but we have vast experience with this process and firmly believe the numbers put forward in this proposal are obtainable.

We estimated that grasslands would reach a new SOC equilibrium after 35 years, on average. This was also cross referenced to published rates on SOC stock values found in cropland versus that of native prairie grasslands, by which restored grassland would have the potential to sequester that difference. We did not include nitrous oxide emissions that would be avoided once the cropland is transitioned to grassland (and fertilizers are no longer applied) given the directive of the RFP. We also did not include methane emissions from enteric fermentation in livestock associated with the project scenario for a few reasons: (1) previously verified accounting methods proved methane emissions were far less than foregone nitrous oxide emissions (that were also not captured given the direction to exclude avoided emissions) (2) the fact that livestock are also present in the baseline scenario and therefore would be relatively de minimus in the project/grassland scenario. If selected and tasked with establishing a new grassland module for the Climate Forward standard, DU commits to completing a thorough scientific life-cycle assessment with diverse stakeholder input. Furthermore, DU would commit to establishing in-field SOC data collection efforts to validate presumed sequestration rates and total stock values.","Our reply to Q26 is based largely on the condition that certification would have to occur prior to June 2021. This is not attainable when having to develop an entirely new module to a standard that requires outside review and a public-comment period. Under our proposed approach, we intend to ultimately achieve certification from CAR, assuming the module is adopted. In the event the module is not adopted, we would complete a literature review of GHG data, perform on-farm monitoring to validate reported numbers, and cross-reference other land-use standards to incorporate terms around leakage, project risk, uncertainty, and reporting.","There are no foreseeable negative environmental or social impacts with the proposed project. It is well-recognized that grasslands and imbedded wetlands play a critical role in storing and purifying water, reducing flood damages, and uplifting biodiversity through habitat suitability for a wide array of species. In fact, there are positive socioeconomic impacts of converting cropland back to grasslands. It should be noted that:  1.	All landowners are participating in the program voluntarily. It is assumingly in their best economic interest to do so, especially with the upfront payment for carbon tonnage (foregone income component).  2.	Much of the cropland targeted for restoration has marginal productivity and thus is not taking much away from the productive base that supports ag-related enterprises.  3.	Our proposal is a working lands proposal. All grassland acres—once established—would be available for grazing and/or haying, therefore retaining the economic base for the landowners and their community.  4.	Restored grasslands deliver many other ecosystem services that provide direct (e.g., recreation) and indirect (e.g., floodwater retention) socioeconomic benefits to local and surrounding communities.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","Not applicable","Water Stewardship: Restoring grasslands from cropland not only increases  soil carbon but also reduces compaction and slows runoff. DU estimates areal and basin-scale runoff reduction resulting from land use change using hydrological models. Embedded in the grasslands DU restores, there are thousands of small “pothole” wetlands that DU also restores. Often these wetlands have been artificially drained, which increase downstream flooding. These wetlands store approximately 1.1 acre-feet of water per wetland acre and are important sources of surface and groundwater recharge. DU uses empirical hydrogeomorphic models, watershed models, and is developing remote sensing protocols to measure annual water storage in our wetland restoration projects.     Clean Water and Improved Water Quality: Restoring grasslands from cropland reduces the need for fertilizer and other inputs and reduces erosion and surface runoff, improving downstream water quality. The wetlands embedded in these grasslands contribute further to nutrient reduction as they tend to be rich in denitrifying bacteria, which convert fertilizer-rich runoff into inert atmospheric nitrogen. Much of the prairie pothole geography drains into the Missouri River and then into the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. We use empirical data and hydrologic models to estimate nutrient-load reductions due to grassland and wetland restoration.     Enhance Biodiversity, Wildlife Habitat and Protection: Grasslands and embedded temperate wetlands are some of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on earth. From just a waterfowl perspective, the Prairie Pothole Region (encapsulating our project region in the Dakotas) is responsible for producing 50-80% of the entire North American waterfowl population. Grassland bird species are the most imperiled bird group on the continent and will benefit from this work. These areas are also rich in native plant and invertebrate species, and increasingly research illustrates their importance for supporting pollinators. As board members and technical committee members of the Prairie Pothole Joint Venture, DU funds, guides and develops science around habitat with a consortium of universities, federal agencies and other nonprofits.     Enhancing Recreation & Economic Benefits: Restoring cropland to grassland is done on a voluntary basis, often because it is more economically viable to graze land or otherwise utilize it in its restored status than to grow row crops. Producers can diversify income streams though grazing leases, hunting leases or other activities (at the landowner’s discretion) that maintain the integrity of the grasslands and embedded wetlands. These grasslands provide breeding habitat for waterfowl and other grassland birds that are often the focal point of recreational pursuits across a much greater area. DU maintains some bird banding data and harvest data to illustrate the connection. There have been numerous studies that highlight the non-market value of the ecosystem services produced off these grasslands, in addition to the economic contribution of linked recreation and tourism. DU has several ongoing projects measuring landowner satisfaction, both economically and otherwise, with conservation programs. DU also participates in several larger coalitions such as Agree the Agricultural Economic and Environmental Risk coalition that is actively assessing the role conservation plays in agricultural economics, insurance and lending.     Fostering Good Health and Well-Being: The U.S. Geological Survey produced a professional paper showing the interconnection between rural community well-being and the preservation of native habitats (namely, open space grasslands). Links were identified between economic vitality and the retention of young professionals in the community. In light of persistently low commodity prices, federal banks have reported a record-high number of farm bankruptcies in 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also stated that farmers are among the most likely to die by suicide, compared to other occupations. The approach outlined in this proposal allows carbon finance to support these landowners seeking an alternative farming system, something the traditional offset standards have in large part failed to accomplish to date.     Manage and/or Minimize Water and Climate-Related Risk: Grassland soils are full of organic matter that can hold water, both maximizing drought resilience and reducing downstream flood risk. In addition to mitigating climate change, increasing soil organic carbon though grassland restoration also helps landowners adapt to climate change impacts.  As summer temperatures rise, greater precipitation falls as rain than snow, and precipitation is more intense and infrequent overall in the Great Plains, row crop agriculture is anticipated to become increasingly volatile. Restoring cropland to grass, grasses adapted to harsh swings in water availability, will increase the resilience of the ecological system and the operations of landowners. It can also reduce the frequency and intensity of downstream flood events. DU agronomists are measuring changes in water infiltration due to increased soil organic matter and DU scientists are also modeling these impacts on the watershed scale. ","Our work with landowners on working landscapes addresses at least one of the systemic barriers to accessing carbon finance. Our innovative approach to apply the Climate Futures standard to grassland restoration would provide a new means to carbon finance that currently does not exist. Traditional offset standards have in large part failed to funnel carbon finance to working landowners. ",,,,,,,,

See Organization Survey Submission response to Q15","Enabling climate-smart forestry in the Pacific Northwest ","EFM Improved Forest Management Group Project","https://efmi.com/management-approach/",,"EFM is offering Microsoft the opportunity to purchase offsets from its Group Improved Forest Management Project. EFM developed this project in 2013 to catalyze the adoption of climate-smart forestland management strategies and climate policy action in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). This is the first IFM project to be verified on private forestland in the region. It showcases the immense carbon sequestration potential of PNW forests and demonstrates that it is possible to successfully manage private commercial forests for multiple values – timber, carbon storage, biodiversity, water filtration etc., while also supporting rural economies and creating financial value for investors. It also serves as an inspiration for policy makers in the region who are grappling with carbon pricing and their impacts on private landowners.     This is also the first grouped IFM project to be developed by a private forestland company under the VCS/Verra protocol, thus allowing EFM to cost-efficiently scale the acres under a single project over time. EFM has over 100,000 acres under its management, and currently ~27,000 acres are enrolled within this carbon project. The project uses the VM003 methodology and was first verified in 2014. It has had two subsequent verifications in 2015 and 2020 generating over 70,000 VCUs to-date. The project could generate ~22,000 VCUs annually, (including removals and emissions avoided). All the offsets produced through 2019 have been sold, mainly to General Motors and Nike. EFM is proposing that MSFT purchase the 2020 offsets and contract with the project for offsets produced between 2021-2024.    The land enrolled within this carbon project is owned by the forestland investment Funds that are managed by EFM. EFM has the exclusive right to develop carbon projects on behalf of the Funds. EFM generates both avoided emissions and carbon removals via its 5-R Climate-Smart management framework. The main way in which the removals are generated are by extending rotation ages, expanding riparian buffers, and retaining trees in harvest units, thereby allowing the forests to grow older, into more mature age-classes.  Thus, the growth of trees results in increased carbon sequestration and removals of emissions from the atmosphere. The payments for this increased carbon sequestration accrue mainly to the Fund’s investors, as compensation for the value that they could have otherwise earned by harvesting the trees and selling logs to the nearby mills. ","Portland","Oregon","United States",157000,80,17000,140000,"2/23/2010","This project has been developed in accordance with the VCS/Verra standards which prescribes monitoring and reporting requirements for all kinds of reversals. The project will meet these standards and will rely on guidance from Verra for reporting and management of buffer credits to guard against reversals. For examples, per VCS, a Loss or reversal event has to be reported within 2 years of the event. Furthermore, Loss events and reversals are reported at each verification event, which are required to occur no less than every 5 years. VCS has partnered with international experts to address concerns around reversals through the development of a pooled buffer account that holds non-trade-able credits to guard against any future reversals of issued VCUs.","Yes","Not applicable (I answered yes to Q24)",,,,"Verra (VCS)",,,,,,"The carbon project activities undertaken to meet the goals of the chosen VCS methodology (VM003), specifically extension of rotation age, do not create any foreseeable potential negative environmental impacts and any potential impacts have been considered during the process of implementing an FSC certified management plan for the properties. The extension of the rotation age and the reduction in harvest intensity in the project areas could potentially result in a lower harvest volumes in the short term, and this is mitigated by the potential that the project actions have to increase the overall volume and quality of wood flow in the longer term. Further, EFM has taken steps to evaluate and implement a non-timber forest product initiative that seeks to increase the jobs and economic opportunity associated with these non-timber products.

These include habitat protection and enhancement for threatened and endangered species and species of interest, water protection, enhancing scenic values, and public access for recreation, hunting, and foraging.  Additional social and cultural benefits are addressed in the response to Q34.     EFM measures the impact of its work using third party standards like FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), IRIS and GIIRS (Global Impact Investment Rating System), which is verified by regular, independent third-party auditors from respected groups like B Lab and FSC. This data both drives management decisions and attracts impact-oriented capital seeking enduring, verifiable impact. Impact metrics are rigorously and systematically quantified and reported annually to investors and stakeholders.  In addition to carbon sequestration, these include:    •	1,230 acres in active restoration projects  •	287 acres treated for fire risk reduction in 2019   •	9,206 acres managed to improve drinking water for local, economically disadvantaged communities  •	666 miles of streams protected with enhanced riperian buffers  •	3,200 acres of forestland transitioned to tribal ownership to date  •	6,500 acres transitioned to conservation-oriented owners or protected by conservation easements  •	100,000 acres under climate-smart forest management and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).

Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) objectives through conservation, restoration and climate-smart management, practices that have been core to EFM’s strategy for over fifteen years.     SDG #6: Clean Water & Sanitation: In the western U.S., over 50% of the fresh water supply comes from forested watersheds. There is increasing recognition of forestland protection for purposes of water protection, creating opportunities for landowners to sell riparian or working forest easements to public interest groups like water and sanitary districts. EFM contributes to improving water quality by enhancing riparian reserves (areas next to streams and rivers), implementing watershed restoration plans on forestland properties and acquiring select properties with the goal of ultimately selling the properties to water districts or other partners that will protect watersheds permanently.      SDG #12 Responsible Consumption & Production:  EFM’s objective is to transition management from short-term intensive fiber maximization strategies to an FSC-certified management approach that produces high-quality logs for sale into local and regional markets alongside creating value through the full attributes of the forest ecosystem. All of EFM’s forests are certified by The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the leading global standard for forest management that expands protection of water quality, prevents loss of natural forest cover, and prohibits highly hazardous chemicals, along with having a democratic governing body that sets it apart from other standards. We believe this certification can lower operating and regulatory risks as it includes diverse stakeholder perspectives and provides investors with an independent annual audit of the Funds’ forest management activities.      SDG #13: EFM combats climate change by both increasing the amount of carbon sequestered by our forests through climate-smart forest management practices and by reducing emissions as compared to conventional harvesting methods.  We believe our management approach, which includes increasing rotation (time between planting and harvest) and retention (trees remaining on the landscape), can enable forests to absorb at least 30% more carbon from the atmosphere after  harvest than business as usual approaches    SDG #15 Life on Land:  Conservation priorities and monitoring are integrated into our forest management. Our management practices increase diversity of tree species, resistance to disease and pests, and age diversity, thereby increasing resilience. Additionally, we work in partnership with conservation groups and public agencies to acquire and transition the management of high-priority conservation forestland into the hands of permanent stewards, which allows us to integrate conservation priorities into our management approach during ownership.  ","EFM holds a deep commitment to equity and diversity as core principles integral to the work we do. As we add new members across all levels of the organization, we seek diverse perspectives and lived experiences that we believe foster learning, creativity, innovation, and equity. EFM, as far as we know, is the only woman-led forest investment management company in the U.S.  Two of the three Managing Directors are women, as is over half of the staff.  The Managing Directors are culturally diverse and include a Peruvian-American and an Indian-born Singaporean.    Local Job Creation  As a forestland investment company, we target the acquisition of forestland in rural, economically depressed regions of the West. There is a strong need for local, family-wage and professional jobs throughout these regions. EFM’s social goals are to create opportunities and value within local communities. EFM anticipates its activities will maintain a local network of forest-related contractors and enterprises. In addition to contracting locally, EFM is committed to employing underrepresented and/or disadvantaged populations whenever possible. Over 60% of employment we support is local and in low income communities.     Access to & ownership of Land:   For millennia access to the bountiful natural resources of our region has been the source of health, wellness and prosperity for local rural communities and Tribes. However, forestland is increasingly now owned and controlled by global financial actors and out of state investors. EFM’s investment strategy is to purchase land from financial and industrial owners and return important landscapes that provide water, hunting and foraging access, and recreation and scenic values, to local control by facilitating property purchase by community forests, water districts, parks, and other public and conservation-oriented entities. This is the broader context that surrounds the properties on which EFM develops our carbon projects. They are part of a broader strategy to acquire and restore natural ecosystems with an explicit focus on creating jobs and providing access to land and resources to economically disadvantaged rural communities.  EFM works with local under-represented communities, Tribes, municipalities and government agencies to identify and acquire lands that are critical to the future of their communities. This is at the heart of our commitment to achieving equity in natural resource ownership.    Work with Tribes & Rural Water Districts:   We have a particular focus on tribes and small rural, water districts.  We help tribes repatriate land that form part of their former ancestral lands and reservations and from which they were forcibly removed.  EFM has completed two tribal land repatriations to date with Pacific Northwest tribes and has three additional repatriations in process. In addition, EFM works closely with tribes on restoration of aquatic and upland habitat and provides access for hunting and foraging.     EFM’s land management focuses intensely on protecting water and restoring streams, wetlands, and aquatic resources with a focus on economically disadvantaged communities.  Over half of the fresh water supply in the Pacific Northwest originates from forests; very little of that is managed for water quality.  Large cities, like Portland and Seattle, have the resources to purchase and manage their watersheds to protect water quality.  Most small rural communities do not.  EFM’s acquisition strategy and climate-smart forest management targets and protects domestic watersheds of economically disadvantaged communities by restoring riparian vegetation, reducing sediment and prohibiting the common industry practice of helicopter spraying of herbicides.     The EFM IFM project currently includes the Garibaldi property where 982 acres of the carbon project lands are located in Moss Creek. This watershed contributes to clean drinking water for the residents of Garibaldi, a small rural town in Oreon with limited resources to invest in municipal grey infrastructure.     Since this is a grouped project, we have other properties where carbon projects can be developed and will facilitate broader conservation goals – especially around drinking water security and tribal land ownership. Future offsets can be developed on properties that speak to the diversity, equity and inclusion goals of Microsoft. ",,,,,,,,

Rather than preventing hypothetical removals as with traditional IFM, carbon removals will be achieved through tree growth.  By changing how this forest is managed, we will increase carbon stocks beyond common practice levels.     Green Diamond is currently in advanced stages of acquiring this forestland. This forest suffered from a long period of over-harvesting by several previous owners. The above-ground live tree carbon is less than half (16.8 MT CO2/acre) of the CARB common practice level (41.06 MT CO2/acre) for the proposed project area. Much of the forest also has an overabundance of small trees, which increases fire- and disease risk.  Green Diamond sees an opportunity to use a carbon project to rehabilitate this forest. We have done preliminary work in establishing a baseline using the High Stocking Reference (HSR) option of the CARB IFM protocol. Because the HSR baseline is expected to be below common practice, carbon credits will become available as new growth occurs.  Stocking on the forest will not be allowed to decrease below the level at which the last carbon removal is captured, making the future forest truly different from its past. Removals are sustained at higher levels through the project life (25 years) and for an additional 100 years of monitoring.     Carbon project revenues will accelerate Green Diamond’s management changes, in particular: extending rotation ages, thinning to reduce density, and using silviculture to maximize long-term growth.  We will manage to increase forest carbon stocks to at least ten times what they are at present.  These changes will have significant near-term financial costs that will be rewarded by healthier and more sustainable timber resources in the long-term.  Future harvests will in turn support the local economy.     Green Diamond is committed to long-term sustained forest growth, but revenue from spot sales of carbon credits will not wholly replace the opportunity cost of deferring timber harvest.  A longer-term offtake agreement with Microsoft at set prices provides the certainty that allows us to continue the forest regrowth process while removing the risk that forest health work must slow when carbon prices drop.    Green Diamond partnerships include L&C Carbon, contractors for carbon inventory data collection and analysis, and third-party verifiers.

This project is a long-term investment in a natural carbon sink that will reduce atmospheric carbon by improving forest health. The project will also increase forest productivity and enhance resiliency to pest outbreaks and wildfires. Co-benefits of the project include:    Improving water quality and quantity (UN Goal 6): Water quality benefits will be achieved through improving overall forest health and resilience, by restoring forests to more natural conditions through thinning overstocked stands, and by reducing further fragmentation of the land base through an extension of rotation ages. The role of forests in watershed health has been well documented in scientific literature. Benefits include improving water quality (reducing pollutants), regulating flow, and protecting aquatic species habitat. Thinning can also improve water quantity. A thinned forest allows more snow to fall to the ground and reduces evapotranspiration, providing more groundwater and extending water yields later into the dry season.     Reducing pest and wildfire risk:  Thinning overstocked stands reduces the risk of the project area suffering catastrophic pest/disease outbreaks or having destructive wildfires. Reducing wildfire risk also increases water quality, as surface water runoff from burned areas results in serious and immediate water quality problems in streams, lakes, and reservoirs.     Forest fragmentation: Logging and fire suppression have subjected coniferous forests in the U.S. to substantial levels of disturbance throughout the last century. Disturbance and fragmentation can contribute to water quality degradation. The project activities will reduce forest fragmentation over the project period and contribute to improvements in water quality in the Flathead watershed basin.     Improving air quality (UN Goal 7): The project improves overall forest health and resilience by restoring forests to more natural conditions through thinning overstocked stands, diversifying the tree species mix, and extending the rotation age of forest stands. These management practices reduce fuel loads, thereby reducing wildfire and local air quality risks. Specifically, project activities include chipper thinning overstocked stands which reduces fuel loads, breaks up fuel continuity that increases tree survivability, and improves fire suppression efforts. The project also increases the average age of trees across the project area. The resulting increased large tree canopy removes certain pollutants - leaves and needles have surface area that can allow for removal (deposition) of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter.    Local Economic Development (UN Goals 8, 9, and 12): The forest management practices used in this project support the use of forests as a truly renewable resource. With an increase in the forest resource, additional employment opportunities will follow in managing the forest as well as in the neighboring communities.

Examples of changed forest practices are: (1) increasing the time between harvests (i.e. extending rotation age), which allows trees to sequester more carbon over their lifetime; (2) controlling overstocked stands through thinning; and (3) using silviculture to maximize long-term forest growth.     Certain management activities—the use of pickup trucks to inspect sites, for instance—do rely on fossil fuels.  However, our lower management intensity compared to prior ownership almost certainly reduces total greenhouse gas emissions.    Almost all the forestland Green Diamond owns in Oregon is open to the public.  As we improve forest health though improved management, we reduce the risk for catastrophic wildfire and smoke inhalation, while improving the quality of outdoor recreation available to the public on our lands.   ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","This project is a long-term investment to improve forest health, increase productivity, and enhance resiliency to pest outbreaks and wildfires while storing greater amounts of carbon. Co-benefits of the project include:    Improving water quality and quantity (UN Goal 6): Water quality benefits will be achieved through improving overall forest health and resilience, by restoring forests to more natural conditions through thinning overstocked stands, and by reducing further fragmentation of the land base through an extension of rotation ages. The role of forests in watershed health has been well documented in scientific literature. The benefits include improved water quality (reduced pollutants), regulating flow, and protecting aquatic species habitat. Thinning can also improve water quantity. A thinned forest allows more snow to fall to the ground and reduces evapotranspiration, providing more groundwater and extending water yields later into the dry season.     Reducing pest and wildfire risk:  Thinning overstocked stands reduces the risk of the project area suffering catastrophic pest/disease outbreaks or having destructive wildfires. Reducing wildfire risk also increases water quality, as surface water runoff from burned areas results in serious and immediate water quality problems in streams, lakes, and reservoirs.     Forest fragmentation: Logging and fire suppression have subjected coniferous forests in the U.S. Pacific Northwest to substantial levels of disturbance throughout the last century. Disturbance patterns across the Klamath River watershed basin indicate that both private and public lands have become increasingly fragmented. This fragmentation can contribute to water quality degradation. The project activities will reduce forest fragmentation over the project period and contribute to improvements in water quality in the Klamath and Sacramento watershed basins.     Improving air quality (UN Goal 7): The project improves overall forest health and resilience by restoring forests to more natural conditions through thinning overstocked stands, diversifying the tree species mix, and extending the rotation age of forest stands. These management practices reduce fuel loads, thereby reducing wildfire- and local air quality risks. Specifically, project activities include chipper thinning overstocked stands which reduces fuel loads, breaks up fuel continuity that increases tree survivability, and improves fire suppression efforts, and it will provide raw material for the Red Rock Biofuels plant that will be producing low carbon renewable biofuels in Lakeview, Oregon. The project also increases the average age of trees across the project area. The resulting increased large tree canopy removes certain pollutants - leaves and needles have surface area that can allow for removal (deposition) of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and to a lesser extent particulate matter.    Local Economic Development (UN Goals 8, 9, and 12): The forest management practices used in this project support the use of forests as a truly renewable resource. With an increase in the forest resource, additional employment opportunities will follow both directly involved in managing the forest but also in the neighboring community.  Klamath County has one of the highest unemployment rates in Oregon and new, sustainable job creation is vital to the community    The project is one of 3 CARB IFM projects located outside of CA that has been awarded DEB status.  This is a formal recognition that it provides environmental benefits beyond the emissions reduction benefits to the state of CA.    Please see the attached document (Application for Direct Environmental Benefits (DEB) Status) for more detail and references. This was submitted for Klamath East (our other Oregon project) because that project did not automatically qualify for DEB status under CARB regulation. However, the benefits apply to both projects.  ","Klamath County is a HUBZone with high historical and present levels of unemployment. In 2019, the highest countywide unemployment rate in Oregon was 6.9%. At 6.2%, Klamath County had among the highest rates of unemployment in Oregon. Jackson County was equivalent to the state average at 4.4% (for reference, US unemployment was 3.7% in 2019). We believe our carbon project and its complementarity with our timber operations will provide economic and health benefits to our communities, and ensure they are not left behind in the transition to an environmentally just future.",,,,,,,,

We have crafted scientific collaborations to further the science behind regenerative agriculture and soil carbon sequestration. ","Soil organic carbon storage from adoption of carbon farming practices","The Indigo Carbon North America-1 project","https://www.indigoag.com/for-growers/indigo-carbon",,"Indigo Carbon is unlocking the potential of agriculture as a scalable, immediate, and affordable opportunity to address climate change by helping farmers adopt carbon farming practices that restore soil health by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Indigo is pleased to offer Microsoft high-integrity, technology-enabled carbon reductions from agriculture.     Carbon farming practices, including cover cropping, reducing tillage, and diversifying crop rotations, are proven to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and build carbon content in the soil. Increased soil carbon enables greater resilience to drought, water retention, and access to nutrients.     Despite the benefits, many of these practices deviate from the status quo of industrial farming. Less than 5% of US row crop farmers practice more than one of these carbon farming practices and less than 1% practice more than three.*     Soil carbon measurement has historically been time-intensive, imprecise, and costly, explaining why no other scalable and affordable market solution to reward soil carbon capture exists.     Indigo leverages data collection, analytics assets, R&D capabilities, and a nation-wide farmer network to measure the impact of carbon farming practices on soil carbon at scale. Three methods are synthesized to quantify soil carbon changes over time. First, we directly sample the bulk density and carbon concentration within a representative subset of our enrolled fields at randomly selected points. Second, we collect grower management data to model annualized carbon concentration changes within fields implementing practice changes. Third, we use remotely-sensed, farm equipment, and other external datasets to inform management practice changes over time. Indigo is making an unprecedented investment in soil sampling to build a data layer that combines annual soil samples with practice and geospatial data to train models and improve data on soil carbon management.    To support farmers in realizing the benefits of carbon farming practices and to assist in minimizing disruption from new practice adoption, Indigo provides education and agronomic support.    The significant majority of Microsoft’s funding will go to farmers as payment for sequestration and transform their economics, and the land will remain in productive use.     Subject to approval and verification, Indigo credits will be issued under new protocols from Verra and the Climate Action Reserve, adhering to their rigorous standards for conservatism, additionality, boundary setting, permanence, data collection, quantification, and issuance as a tradeable carbon assets. We offer offsets produced by farmers in the United States, with projects in Europe and Latin America forthcoming.    *Source:_USDA_report_“Tillage_Intensity_and_Conservation_Cropping_in_the_United States,”_September_2018","N/A","21 states in the American Midwest and Southeast growing regions, expanding to new states in 2021","United States",6225000,33,25000,6200000,"11/1/2018","Indigo’s methodology requires a 100-year permanence term. (Note this is the standard defined by Verra and the Climate Action Reserve.) To secure it, we monitor for and provide recourse for all reversals, whether they happen intentionally or unintentionally.   Our system gives growers in decades to come enduring, scientifically rooted incentives to restore the level of carbon in their soil. . In addition, we have found that carbon farming is substantially more profitable for growers once they have overcome the initial costs of the transition. Based on over 100 interviews with carbon farmers, we see profitability increases of $45/acre in year 5 of the transition. This provides another incentive for growers to continue with the practices and maintain (or continue to increase) their soil organic carbon levels. (See the “Permanence Discussion” section of our “Indigo Carbon Proposal Overview for Microsoft RFP” attachment for a fuller treatment of how our project ensures permanence, beyond the direct answer below.)       How we monitor:    In addition to standard direct data collection from growers (performed annually, with checks on data rigor verified by third parties), Indigo monitors its participating acres through our Atlas satellite analytics platform. Atlas gives us the ability to detect activities like tilling or other land use changes with field-level precision. Rather than rely on our words, we encourage you to check out one of visualizations here – https://indigoag.unfolded.ai/map/regen. (Zoom all the way in for field-level resolution of detected changes.)     Recently Indigo has leveraged this technology to launch the largest field-scale regenerative / carbon farming study ever undertaken, covering 3.4 million fields over three years, and spanning 90% of American farmland. Our initial results - https://www.indigoag.com/progress-report - illustrate the power this technology already has to drive both effective monitoring and grower insights. We are committed to further extending this technology and peer-reviewing its results to ensure maximum scientific rigor as our project continues.     To show that commitment to making our results available for review by the scientific community, we also published this white paper on our methods for constructing this study: https://www.indigoag.com/hubfs/Progress%20Report/Indigo%20Progress%20Report%20Methodology.pdf?hsLang=en-us. It has been well-received by the scientific community. We are just at the start of this journey, and Indigo is committed to transparency to deliver scientific insights that help make our solution and the science of soil carbon sequestration even more robust.        How we report and provide recourse:    “Avoidable reversals”: these reversals are caused by intentional changes by the grower - e.g., a farmer exits the program, generating a negative climate impact. Our program is designed to make this a very rare event: we use a vesting schedule for growers that cuts off payment from credits they have earned previously if they experience a reversal, and carbon farming practices will lead to long-term profit improvements for the grower that further encourage sticking with the program. In cases when an avoidable reversal does happen, Indigo uses its “net credit” approach to ensure that the negative climate impact of one farm will be compensated by the positive climate impact of another. This like-for-like replacement ensures the permanence of our credits.     In supporting materials, we have included an analysis of the level of farmer attrition required to trigger a complete, program-level reversal. We would need to see rates of ~50% or more growers exiting in the program. Though possible, it is unlikely given the increase in profitability from carbon farming practices (which we have also included in the “Permanence Discussion” section of our “Indigo Carbon Proposal Overview for Microsoft RFP” attachment).     “Unavoidable reversals”: these reversals are caused by unintentional changes not under the grower’s control – e.g., a fire or flood consumes a field, generating a negative climate impact.     For each vintage, Indigo’s registry holds a percentage of its measured tonnes (based on conservative projections), not to be issued as credits, and forms a buffer pool. For unavoidable reversals, the registry retires credits from this buffer pool as compensation.     Indigo reports reversals to the registry as a standard part of its regular credit issuance process to continuously activate the mechanisms above.","Yes","Not applicable (I answered yes to Q24)",,,"CAR","Verra (VCS)",,,,,,"Indigo’s program is designed not only to ensure positive environmental and social impacts, but to avoid negative ones. We use the most rigorous measurement approaches available to make that promise credible.    First, we take a comprehensive approach to measuring net GHG emissions on the farm: in addition to soil organic carbon (SOC), we measure methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), soil organic carbon (SOC) and carbon dioxide emissions from operations due to diesel fuel (CO2). This ensures each batch of credits reflects the true, net climate benefit.     Second, we safeguard against leakage by monitoring for yield decreases over the long term that could theoretically lead to an expansion in farmland elsewhere, potentially causing the destruction of native ecosystems. A recent long-term study revealed that conservation cropping practices such as no-till result in yield increases over time (https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=300631&org=NSF&from=news). Still, to maximize the credibility of our program, we monitor yield and for any yield decrease above 5% commit to a deduction in credits. We believe this approach to land-use leakage is more robust than that of any other methodology.     Finally, we believe the social impacts of this program are entirely positive.

Under the guidance of SustainCERT, GS has agreed to fast-track the methodology review and approval process.    Today, GS only has an approved activity for “improved tillage.” This module explicitly excludes no-tillage and strip-tillage. The narrow focus of this methodology does not generate enough CDR to be economically feasible for any stakeholder. By adding additional activity modules, we can leverage GS’s Soil Organic Carbon Framework and work with Soil Health Institute (SHI) and SustainCERT to develop protocols for a broader range of practices.

When carbon is restored to agricultural soils by building soil organic matter, it generally makes the soils more fertile, better at retaining water and fertilizer, and more resilient to climate change. Thus, the restoration of soil carbon on agricultural lands offers a number of co-benefits to carbon sequestration. These include increased food production per acre, better livelihoods for farmers, their families, and rural communities, improved water quality, enhanced wildlife habitat, and less pressure to convert remaining forests to agriculture.    The Truterra platform, specifically, enables field-by-field quantification of these benefits for farmers in terms of the return on their farming investment. Modeling tools enable farmers to assess the profitability of their fields, and continuously improve land utilization by focusing crop production inputs and resources on the most productive fields while encouraging exploration of conservation uses (water quality buffers, enhanced pollinator or wildlife habitat, dedicated carbon sinks, etc.) on less productive cropping lands.  ","Agriculture is being disproportionately impacted by climate change. The agriculture industry in the U.S. suffered through several extremely difficult weather challenges in 2019, when record-setting floods prohibited planting on nearly 20 million acres of farmland. In addition to negatively impacting crop production and revenue-generating opportunities, the mental and emotional devastation and hardships created by this unprecedented situation have taken a toll on farmers, distributors, retailers and the rural communities where they live and do business.     In addition, rural communities are already behind their urban counterparts in both population growth and income.  The United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service reports that rural counties experienced a nearly 2 percent decrease in population from 2010 to 2018, whereas urban counties saw a 7 percent increase. Likewise, while U.S. poverty rates declined from 2013 to 2019, income per person remained stubbornly low in non-metro areas at less than $40,000.    The USDA noted reductions in farm income as one of the key factors in this rural-urban disparity.  For these reasons, investing in rural-based CDR projects has the potential to not only mediate areas experiencing the greatest impact from climate change, but also create new income sources to improve rural livelihoods and attract new residents.

The Truterra platform, specifically, enables field-by-field quantification of these benefits for farmers in terms of the return on their farming investment. Modeling tools enable farmers to assess the profitability of their fields, and continuously improve land utilization by focusing  crop production inputs and resources on the most productive fields while encouraging exploration of conservation uses (water quality buffers, enhanced pollinator or wildlife habitat, dedicated carbon sinks, etc.) on less productive cropping lands.  ","Agriculture is being disproportionately impacted by climate change. The agriculture industry in the U.S. suffered through several extremely difficult weather challenges in 2019, when record-setting floods prohibited planting on nearly 20 million acres of farmland. In addition to negatively impacting crop production and revenue-generating opportunities, the mental and emotional devastation and hardships created by this unprecedented situation have taken a toll on farmers, distributors, retailers and the rural communities where they live and do business.     In addition, rural communities are already behind their urban counterparts in both population growth and income.  The United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service reports that rural counties experienced a nearly 2 percent decrease in population from 2010 to 2018, whereas urban counties saw a 7 percent increase. Likewise, while U.S. poverty rates declined from 2013 to 2019, income per person remained stubbornly low in non-metro areas at less than $40,000.  The USDA noted reductions in farm income as one of the key factors in this rural-urban disparity.    For these reasons, investing in rural-based CDR projects has the potential to not only mediate areas experiencing the greatest impact from climate change, but also create new income sources to improve rural livelihoods and attract new residents.

Option 1A, detailed herein, uses the Soil Enrichment Protocol, which is currently pending acceptance by the Climate Action Reserve (CAR). This standard, along with the Verra/VCS Methodology for Improved Ag Land Management, have been developed with similar methodologies.  These are the only two methodologies available that 1) cover a full-range of soil carbon best practices commonly used by U.S. production agriculture, and 2) have a pathway for ICROA-approval. Both have gone through public comment periods and are anticipated to be accepted by respective standards bodies sometime in the Fall of 2020. While the protocols are not final, Truterra believes this is the most expedient approach to delivering accredited tonnage to Microsoft by June 2021.    Key steps include:   1.	Leverage Truterra retail network to identify and onboard growers meeting project criteria to the Insights Engine  2.	Capture baseline data and additionality opportunity for acreage sufficient to remove 100,000 MT CO2e and also meet buffer pool requirements; anticipated to be 200,000 - 250,000 acres of U.S. farmland that has reduced tillage and/or added a cover crop to their rotation since 2018      3.

The grant also funded AES’s development of a SOC quantification methodology under the Verified Carbon Standard (“VCS”), for the ultimate, express purpose of developing a carbon offset project using the methodology (“VM0021”) for SOC quantification.  The soil samples were taken across a sufficient variety of both cropping practices and years under each cropping practice such that a longitudinal statistical model could be constructed to show how accrual rates change and stabilize over time under each of the variety of practices.  The model now predicts SOC stocking levels on fields not sampled (from losses or gains), based on years in the given practice and the stratification of such fields following the stratification requirements of VM0021.

"Natural Capital Partners Americas, LLC","Natural Capital Partners and the Arbor Day Foundation are two like-minded organizations that have partnered for many years on projects to protect and restore forests.   Our collaboration has included the supply of non-market-based forest restoration projects, as well as the sourcing of forestry carbon credits from a wide range of high-quality international nature-based projects including REDD+. The unique global reach, market presence and project portfolios of both entities is regularly leveraged to provide the most comprehensive project solutions to our respective clients and corporate partners.     The Arbor Day Foundation is the supplier of CDR credits through the Mississippi Alluvial Valley reforestation project. The Foundation’s specialty is accelerating CDR reforestation and agroforestry projects that create verified carbon credits and forestry-based social enterprises. We also originate innovative forestry carbon credit and value chain portfolios aligned to the Protect, Manage and Restore natural climate solutions framework.    The proposed project aligns to the Foundation’s Guiding Principles for Forest Restoration and meets our quality requirements for additionality and permanence.    Guiding Principles for Investments in Forest Restoration   The Arbor Day Foundation seeks and welcomes diverse partnerships. We believe that alignment with our mission, vision, and core values leads to successful projects and outcomes. Beyond this, we use four guiding principles to identify high-quality and credible partnerships for our work in forest restoration.    •	Act with character and integrity. We ensure that our work and the work of our partners supports our mission, vision, and core values.   •	Plant the right tree, at the right time, in the right place, for the right purpose. Then, grow a diverse and native forest with proven forest resiliency and forest management plans.   •	Respect, empower and benefit local people and communities. We promote equity and collaboration to secure the long-term success of our projects and our people.   •	Align to science-based frameworks and goals. Forested landscapes need protection, better management, and restoration. In addition to making high-quality and high-integrity forestry investments, humanity must reduce greenhouse gas emissions rapidly to stabilize the climate.     Our General Position on Additionality and Permanence   The Arbor Day Foundation brand is grounded in our definitions and track-record of elevating reforestation efforts that meet our standards of quality including both clear additionality and permanence. Forests are dynamic, our values are not.       Our Theory on Additionality   •	We focus on restoring degraded lands where trees and forests are an ecologically appropriately intervention.  •	A future forested state would not be achieved without our intervention.   •	This intervention enhances or restores a native ecosystem.   •	This forest was affected by a natural or human-caused disturbance and will not naturally regenerate.   •	There is not a compliance or regulatory requirement for our forest restoration projects.   •	Measurable new co-benefits such as carbon removed, biodiversity enhanced, watersheds improved, and new landholder revenues generated.   •	If prescribing to the above points, Afforestation/Reforestation projects will have low leakage risk.    Our Theory on Permanence   •	Our goal is to plant and maintain enough trees to result in a thriving, sustained forest, not that every tree survives; rather, that a forest is created, and ecosystem services are enhanced.    •	Collaboration and buy-in from local communities and people is essential.   •	Three to five years is typically a turning point towards long-term project success.  •	Monitoring of seedling survivability is ongoing and reporting is available in our project implementation costs.    •	All the projects we support have ongoing forest management plans.  •	If diversified financial incentives exist to keep forests as forests, these forests are more likely to remain.  •	Assess the political risks that exist in the project jurisdiction.  •	Permanence differs by forest location, landowner type, project-level pressures, and methodology.

Landowners commit to protecting the trees. Limited harvest is allowed after trees grow to the point where crowding of trees is expected to cause some trees to die, but in no case may harvesting occur if it would result in a basal area of live trees of less than 100 square feet per acre after the harvesting. Tree planting is interplanting of fast-growing cottonwoods and native hardwoods. The cottonwoods protect the hardwoods from direct sun, which speeds the growth of the hardwoods. Cottonwoods are planned to be removed from the stand in the first 25 years of the project, resulting in a native hardwood forest. This project design and execution results in a carbon credit that is 100% CDR from the atmosphere.    The project started in February 2008. Over 550 small and medium sized landowners (from 7-1,700 acres) have enrolled in the project.  Over 42 million trees have been planted on more than 120,000 acres, resulting in over five million tonnes of CO2 sequestration to-date.    As a co-funder of the project’s tree planting and carbon credit offtake activities, the Arbor Day Foundation has planted more than 5.3 million trees on this project and is the project’s largest carbon buyer, co-originating and contracting over 2.2 million metric tons to-date.

It has followed the ACR program design which includes sections on environmental and social impacts, as well as stakeholder consultations.    The planting of trees on cropland is not expected to result in clearing trees for more cropland elsewhere. Quite simply, it is expensive to clear trees to make crop land, and the returns from cropping do not pay for the cost of stump removal. With respect to deforestation by those landowners participating in the project, a few factors mitigate this possibility. First, landowners grow crops to provide revenue and the project provides alternative revenue. Second, the project seeks landowners who are interested in providing forest habitat, thus disinclined to remove forest elsewhere. Third, all sites are visited at least annually; as forest clearing is very obvious, landowners would be unlikely to risk their project participation.    Flooding is common on project lands and, once established, planted species are very tolerant of flooding. Species selection mitigates flood risk and site selection mitigates drought risk.

Research for this project revealed concerns about Southern Pine Beetle, Laurel Wilt Disease, and Redbay Abrosia Beetle, but disease and pests appear to be minor enough that mortality is not regularly surveyed. For example, review of the Mississippi Forestry Commission forest health web pages did not reveal any quantification of the extent of tree mortality from disease. Also, the tree species most at risk are not planted on project lands.    Wind disturbance also appears to be only a modest hazard to project forests. The 2009 Forest Service forest inventory report states that despite significant damage to trees in Mississippi caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Mississippi’s total tree volume increased by 25 percent from the inventory conducted in 1994 to the 2006 inventory. Despite being miles from the Gulf Coast, major wind disturbance events conceivably could occur as frequently as every 10-25 years. However, geographic dispersal of project lands mitigates wind loss risk.     The project exhibits de minimal fire risk. Project lands are moist and rarely dry enough to burn. Cumulatively, from 1991 through 2005, less than 0.1% of the Mississippi delta physiographic region (the region where project lands are located) forests burned.  Ignitions are frequent, but only a small area burns. Also, fires in Mississippi are correlated with pine forests and the project establishes hardwood forest. Even if a fire were to become ignited on project lands, it is highly unlikely that the fire would burn more than a few acres. Even an intense fire that kills all trees consumes only a fraction of the biomass. Tree boles, typically branches, and much of the roots, remain after fires. This dead wood then decomposes over time, as remaining live trees grow. Also, project lands are geographically dispersed. Even if a wildfire were to occur within project lands, it would not spread across non-contiguous ownerships.    Issues of land rights and displacement are not present.  Project lands are in the US where land ownership is rarely disputed. Ownership and use rights are held by the same entity.  Unlike projects implemented in developing countries, where large numbers of people may be using project lands for subsistence purposes, or may have use claims to lands, these issues do not exist.

Also, water quality will greatly benefit from afforested riparian buffers. Reforestation minimizes soil erosion and absorbs farm chemicals from surface runoff and groundwater, thereby reducing contamination of streams by sediment, pesticides, and fertilizer.    With respect to biodiversity, reforestation restores wildlife habitat, and the project is estimated to have restored habitat for some 40 species. Studies on the effects of reforestation in the MAV have shown that reforested land contains significantly more varieties of species as compared with land that has not been reforested. A study by the U.S. Forest Service states that the project’s type of planting performs holds twice the amount of birds than other forms of reforestation.    Another significant co-benefit is economic development.  The project provides sustainable income to low-income landowners, helping them maintain ownership of their land while contributing to conservation. Furthermore, harvesting of wood products will produce jobs for harvesters, wood processors, and those who support those wood product production activities.

Your carbon reduction goals are met in a way that regenerates grassland ecology, restores natural water resilience and revitalizes the rural economy.    Large scale, inexpensive, reliable, and effective carbon capture and storage is available through natural ecological systems.  For hundreds of millions of years, plants have taken carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turned it into sugars via photosynthesis. The sugars are transported through the roots and provided to microorganisms in exchange for nutrients. In this way the plant captures atmospheric carbon dioxide and pumps it into the soil. Grasslands managed in a regenerative way have the capacity to reliably store between 0.5 to >6 tCO2/acre/year. If 50% of the US grasslands are managed in a regenerative way the annual CO2 storage capacity be 0.6 – 1.5 billion tCO2/yr.

The existing de-carbonization protocols were not designed to optimize nature-based carbon capture and storage by private landowners.    Current “Kyoto” CDM based standards block soil carbon storage at any scale, due to the conventional “additionality” criteria. Obviously, the additionality concept is important, but in the way the additionality criteria are currently applied, these standards are not suitable for use at scale in agriculture. Regenerative agriculture is based on healthy soils. These healthy soils lead to storage of atmospheric CO2 in soil, but also lead to more profitable farms and ranches. Because regenerative farms and ranches are in principal more profitable, they are excluded to provide soil carbon storage credits, under the existing standards. If management for healthy soils becomes best practice farmers and ranchers are excluded from delivering soil carbon storage credits. The existing standards are in fact highly effective in blocking the growth of carbon farming. That is why The Rice University Baker Institute stakeholder group has developed a new standard. A standard that works for landowners and carbon storage buyers. The new standard is not less robust or less rigorous, to the contrary. It is a measurement-based standard that only support the real absolute increase of soil carbon storage.    Since, most likely, 90% of US grazing land has lost tremendous amounts of soil carbon due to overgrazing and use of land management techniques that compromise soil health, there is an incredible soil carbon storage capacity to be unlocked. The novel standard enables that landowners who manage for healthy soils are rewarded in a fair way, for the ecological service they provide.  This also unlocks the ecological regeneration of America’s grasslands.    ","The metrics guidelines of the novel Baker Institute Soil Carbon Storage standard are directed toward measuring the accumulation of below-ground carbon within soils over time.  These measurements are aimed at providing adequate data as input to the process of creating soil carbon storage credits. These guidelines are limited to soil carbon measurements only and do not encompass the evaluation of the change of other GHG emissions associated with the land management practices.  Land management practices that are applied to a property for the purpose of the carbon accrual need only be shown NOT to substantially increase the GHG emissions of the land management practices in place prior to adopting that new land management practice. Any “above ground” reductions in GHG emissions due to the improved land management practices, do NOT qualify for carbon credits under the new standard. In other words, it must be proven that there is no increase in above ground GHG emissions, but a reduction doesn’t qualify for credits (since these are offset as emission reduction credits and not CDR).  ","Surprisingly, there are hardly any negative side effects.   Soil carbon storage occurs in healthy soils with a healthy grassland ecology. Soil carbon storage occurs where landowners work with nature and not against nature. As shown in the answer to question 32 there are many incredibly important co-benefits.  ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Water resilience:  Healthy soils in regenerative ranches store 8-10x more water than their neighbors on the other side of the fence. This creates a strong draught resistance of these ranches. As regenerative ranchers quote; “It is not how much rain you get, it is how much water your soil will hold”. Strong soil water infiltration has been measured at many regenerative ranches.    Soil health and Grassland Ecology  Ranches managed in a regenerative way will rapidly restore soil health with abundant soil microorganisms. These ranches will show abundant and diverse insects, vegetation, wildlife and birds.   This soil carbon storage solution is about working with nature, not against nature. It is about enabling natural ecology to do what it has been doing for billions of years. It is about undoing and reversing the impacts of an engineered mechanical mindset on our agricultural system.     Healthy food systems with abundant essential micronutrients    Rural economic resilience  Farms and ranches managed in a regenerative way will become more profitable. This increased profitability is based on higher outputs – more vegetation growth, and less input. No or strongly reduced costs of fertilizer, antibiotics, pesticides etc. This is a main driver to manage a farm or ranch with nature and not against nature.  The additional income a rancher will get for providing the soil carbon storage ecological service provides a strong additional stimulus for ranchers to manage for soil health.    Grassland cooling effects.  Some researchers claim that the cooling effect of healthy grassland ecology and the related impact on water vapor, might even be more substantial on climate crisis reversal than the soil C storage impact.  [Retallack et al, 2013, Annual review of Earth and Planetary Sciences – Vol 41: 69-86, 2014].    Soil erosion prevention.  Due to conventional farming practices, nearly half of the most productive soil has disappeared in the world in the last 150 years [UN FAO], threatening crop yields and contributing to nutrient pollution, dead zones and erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished. Healthy soils reverse erosion.    Eliminating the need for big-ag industrial, chemically assisted animal feed corn production  In principle there is no need to grow corn to feed cattle. Cattle should graze grasslands in a regenerative way. This will further eliminate the use of fertilizer, pesticides, soil erosion and loss of soil carbon.  ","Many US rural communities are suffering. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Americans who work in farming, ranching and agricultural management have some of the highest suicide rates in the nation.  We aim to remove barriers for farmers and ranchers to migrate to more sustainable and profitable land management practices. We make it easier for ranchers to adapt their land management practices for healthy soils by providing the following support:   •	Ranchers participating in the first years will be partly paid in SVX equity and can thus share in the success of soil carbon storage.  •	grants to consultant support on their ranch  •	inclusion in a network of ranchers to share best practices and lessons learned   •	free initial soil carbon measurements   •	the opportunity for additional income from the sales of soil carbon storage certificates    ",,,,,,,,

These managed forests cover 23,000 acres in the globally-important Clinch River Valley. The Clinch River itself is recognized worldwide for its incredible diversity of rare freshwater mussels and fish. The mountains and valleys that surround the river are a core part of one of North America’s most critical migratory corridors for plants and animals adjusting to a warming climate. The Clinch Valley is part of   Virginia’s coal country: an economically-challenged region of Central Appalachia going through a profound change due to the industry’s decline. Without TNC’s Clinch Conservation Forestry Program these forests would be vulnerable to clear-cutting and degradation by landowners who depend on these forests for income.  The program’s climate-smart forest management not only increases carbon sequestration in the forests of enrolled properties, it also and provides a stable source of income for participating landowners. They receive an annual payment from TNC, and in exchange, TNC maintains full control over how their forest is managed. Microsoft’s purchase of carbon credits from the program will help to support these management activities and landowner payments.  The program is led by two professional foresters who are supported by an aquatic scientist and a landscape ecologist/wildlife specialist. The lead forester, Greg Meade, has deep experience in successfully developing and implementing forest carbon projects and has been the lead on these carbon projects since their inception, including several verifications.  In addition to carbon project management, the team oversees all forest restoration activities, which include planning and implementing carefully designed commercial timber harvests, controlling invasive species, conducting non-commercial timber stand improvement practices, completing forest inventories and other ecological monitoring, leading field tours with other forestry professionals, and establishing exclusion fencing to protect sensitive caves and other native wildlife habitats from nearby livestock.  The team also maintains our program’s third-party certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (https://us.fsc.org/en-us).  Every enrolled property has permanent legal protection via conservation easement (or, in one case, The Nature Conservancy’s fee simple ownership). Additionally, our registration as a certified forest carbon offset project (under the guidelines of the California Air Resources Board) requires a 100-year commitment to sustainable forest management.

Furthermore, sites chosen for participation in the program are strategically located in the watershed of the globally-important Clinch River System—one of the most biodiverse rivers in North America harboring one of the highest concentrations of rare aquatic species on the continent. Our program seeks out landowners whose properties contain forests and streams that have a significant influence on water quality in the greater Clinch River system.   Therefore, our sustainable management practices on properties enrolled in our program do not just help to sequester carbon, but they also restore forest health and benefit globally rare species downstream.      Our efforts at protecting and improving the quality of water flowing from the forested properties that we manage into in the receiving Clinch River also has a direct benefit to the health of human communities who draw their drinking water from the Clinch.  And our maintenance of forest health and of water quality supports a growing regional tourism industry that is focused on the Clinch and its recreational potential for fishing, canoeing, and other outdoor activities.        The Clinch River System is also at the heart of the Appalachians, which has outsized importance for conserving biodiversity and stabilizing our climate. The Appalachians are home to some of the largest, most ecological diverse temperate forests on Earth and form one of North America’s most critical migratory corridors by which plants and animals adjust to warming temperatures. Already scientists see plants and animals shifting an average of 11 miles north and 30 feet up in elevation per decade. The portion of the Appalachians at the juncture of Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, where this program operates, harbors the greatest amount of biodiversity in the lower 48 states, a fact attributable to both geology and isolation. Preserving forests here—and especially returning these forests to health—will both store greater amounts of carbon and preserve more plants and animals.  ","The counties located in the Clinch Valley are some of the most economically challenged areas in Virginia and the broader eastern United States. According to the Appalachian Regional Commission, which classifies counties in Appalachia based on a mix of income, poverty, and unemployment statistics, most counties in the Clinch Valley are either considered “at-risk” or “distressed” (https://www.arc.gov/research/MapsofAppalachia.asp?MAP_ID=137). Operating in this context, The Nature Conservancy has worked to develop conservation programs in the Clinch Valley that benefit nature but also meet the needs of people. By helping to maintain sustainable working forests, the Clinch Valley Conservation Forestry program represents an important bridge strategy that focuses simultaneously on restoring forest health and providing economic opportunities to local people.  Our Conservation Forestry Program evolved out of the need to balance conservation with the need of local landowners to generate income in an economically distressed region. For many of these landowners, their forests have evolved into savings accounts that they harvest every 30 years to meet a major family need: to help send a child to college or meet a medical emergency. Even landowners who wish to retain their woods get drawn into this boom-and-bust approach to forest management out of economic need. TNC’s program provides them with an alternative that is beneficial to their income and the health of the forest.    The success of this program has inspired other, community-based efforts, within The Nature Conservancy and, more specifically, within this region of Appalachia. TNC’s Clinch Valley Program has been operating in Southwestern Virginia since 1989. These deep roots have allowed us to witness the economic challenges of living here and to seek ways of marrying conservation and economic well-being. For instance, TNC’s Clinch Valley Program has been a leader in a grassroots-initiated effort to create a state park on Clinch River—both to create an incentive for communities along its route to protect this river and to spur conservation-compatible economic development. The park is now within a couple of years of opening. Already, communities have witnessed significant climbs in tourism and tourism-related industries. Although the pandemic has curtailed these activities, it has not squashed them, which is an encouraging sign for these communities.   TNC is also advocating for siting solar energy on previously coal-mined lands. With coal mining in permanent decline here, solar power offers a means of putting this land to good use, generating well-paying jobs, and encouraging clean energy that is truly green.    In the coming years, TNC also hopes to broaden its Conservation Forestry Program to include more landowners and increase the number of family-owned forests that could participate in the carbon market economy.

"The Nature Conservancy","Spatial Informatics Group, LLC – Project Developer","Tackling climate change and community resilience in Cascadia’s temperate rainforests","Washington Rainforest Renewal Project",,,"Washington’s coastal rainforests harbor some of the lower 48 states most productive forest, freshwater and marine systems. Major conservation efforts have focused on Olympic National Park (a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve) and Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary, and also recognized wild salmon strongholds within the Quillayute, Hoh, Queets and Quinault Rivers.     The lowland areas of the Washington coast harbor its most productive forests and wild salmon streams. It is also the area most impacted by more than a century of industrial forest management with clear cut rotations that have degraded streams and almost eliminated some of the world’s most majestic old-growth forests. In response, we have launched a strategy that blends philanthropic capital and proceeds from carbon sales to support restoration efforts in the Olympic Rainforest and Willapa Bay creating conservation corridors from summit to sea.     Enormous amounts of carbon are sequestered when TNC acquires industrially managed timberland and uses improved forest management to restore old forest habitat and function along critical river corridors and salmon strongholds. However, as properties are brought into TNC’s management pool they are typically young and well below the regional carbon baseline. The carbon sequestration in these early years is uncompensated under current market conditions. Nevertheless, our existing portfolio of 22,855 acres of forestland has matured to stocking above baseline, and can now support our first carbon sale. We estimate that this first project will generate more than 2,900,000 credits over 20 years, including more than 2,100,000 credits that are attributable to removals only.    We plan to combine these sale proceeds with philanthropic contributions to ramp up our restoration activities and to launch new carbon offset projects across the entire coastal rainforest region, which we refer to as the Emerald Edge. The Emerald Edge is the largest coastal temperate rainforest remaining in the world, spanning 100 million acres from Alaska to Washington, and boasts water, fisheries, and timber that quite literally feed and house nations. It is a powerhouse of sustainable tourism with room to grow, and a recreational heart and soul for communities that extend far beyond its borders.     Our close partners in this strategy include First Nations and tribes who call this region their home. These forests and waters have been the center of their livelihood and culture since time immemorial. Their relationship with nature and knowledge of what it means to steward this landscape are integral to its past, present, and future.

With that said, we are engaged in a long-term science experiment in the 5,000-acre Ellsworth Creek watershed to better understand the carbon impact of this type of management. For the Ellsworth experiment, we divided the watershed into basins with different management regimes and have since conducted extensive monitoring to test and evaluate the impact of these different management regimes on forest structure, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. New results from that effort will be reported in 2021, and we will then adapt our management strategies to increase the multiple benefits generated by this project, including carbon sequestration.     In any case, the carbon footprint from this type of adaptive, restoration-based management is minimal as compared to the carbon footprint of industrial logging that would have otherwise resulted without our intervention. In this respect, despite the possibility of emissions from our management activities, the carbon impact of the project is net sequestering.

The Willapa Bay estuary and marine upwelling zones along the Olympic Coast support diverse and valuable fisheries that have enriched tribes for thousands of years and economically sustained communities through commercial fishing. TNC’s strategy of protecting and restoring forests along the coast’s most important wild rivers is designed to increase not only carbon stocks and wildlife habitat, but also the delivery of clean water and more productive streams for salmon and other fish, that in turn feeds abundance throughout the coastal marine ecosystem.    TNC’s conservation within Washington’s coastal temperate rainforest region specifically targets the healthiest and most productive wild salmon fisheries (WDFW and tribal data, Wild Salmon Center stronghold mapping). In the Olympic Rainforest, the Hoh and Clearwater Rivers are home to healthy and wild runs of Chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, coastal cutthroat, and bull trout. The estuaries of Willapa Bay and Ellsworth Creek support some of the coast’s largest runs of chum salmon. TNC’s scientists worked with colleagues from federal and state agencies, and universities to design an approach to rebuild habitat productivity in these streams where salmon return to spawn and rear. Their conclusion was that by expanding riparian forest buffers along large river floodplains and their key tributaries from 150 feet (minimum required under Washington Forest Practice Rules) to an optimum of 800 feet or more could potentially more than double salmon productivity. As TNC acquires and protects these areas, the specific objective is to actively restore mature and old forest habitat within this riparian zone. As these forests regrow, their shade cools stream temperatures, a diverse forest structure reduces and filters sediment input to the stream, and most importantly as large trees naturally topple they create the stream habitat complexity required by salmon for spawning and rearing. Salmon productivity measurements taken by TNC and tribal scientists will be able to quantify the results of this forest conservation and restoration strategy as it plays out over the next few decades.    Numerous studies have demonstrated the connection between mature forests and a decreased influx of sediment, dissolved organic carbon, nitrates, and phosphates and other compounds to nearshore estuarine and marine systems when compared to younger and more heavily managed forests. Washington’s coastal marine system supports some of North America’s most valuable fisheries, including; oysters, Dungeness crab, salmon, groundfish and other species. Willapa Bay and other estuarine areas are also critical stopover points for hundreds of thousands of migrating shorebirds and waterfowl. Restoration of mature and old forests along rivers such as the Hoh, Clearwater/Queets, and Ellsworth Creek in Willapa Bay help to provide clean water and other nutrients necessary for sustaining the productivity of these coastal resources and their economic value. Both tribal and non-tribal communities along the coast depend on salmon and other fisheries for their economic and cultural livelihood.     As coastal rainforests regrow and sequester carbon, they also create habitat for threatened species such as the marbled murrelet and northern spotted owl, and other uncommon or significant wildlife species such as Pacific fisher, Roosevelt elk, bald eagle, northern goshawk, and numerous amphibians and mollusks. Federal and state species recovery plans for the murrelet and owl highlight the significance of older forest habitat for these species. The plans also show there is not nearly enough suitable habitat currently available on state and federally owned lands on the Washington coast to recover these species. Additional habitat will need to be regrown with forest restoration. Some of the most productive potential future habitat is found in lowland coastal areas where TNC is working, and projects in Ellsworth Creek and the Olympic Rainforest have specifically been identified as supporting federal and state habitat recovery goals and Washington Department of Natural Resource’s federal habitat conservation plan. TNC’s scientists work together with federal and state partners to monitor the recovery of habitat through measurements of habitat regrowth and species counts.     The foregoing co-benefits are aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals, as described below.    Biodiversity / SDG 15, Life on Land  FSC Certification requires landscape-level planning to include set asides due to representative sample areas of ecosystems that would otherwise occur on the property, as well as areas with high conservation value. As described above, our management exceeds the FSC certification requirements, and our selection of these properties for restoration was the result of a science-based analysis prioritizing areas important to globally-significant salmon populations and biodiversity.  Water Quality / SDGs 6, Clean Water and Sanitation, and 14, Life Below Water  FSC Certification requiring buffers and adherence to best management practices around riparian areas, steep slope protection and the protection of sensitive water and wetland features.

Enhanced Rural Livelihoods / SDG 1, No Poverty, and SDG 10, Reduced Inequalities  The Washington Rainforest Renewal Project supports rural economies in numerous ways. First,   through our restoration based forest management, which generally provides a steady source of employment for high-skilled, local labor. (Our restoration-based forestry includes multiple-entry, below-canopy thinning, which generally requires treatment prescriptions that are more frequent and complicated than on industrially-managed lands.) Second, by initiating and funding business competitions that are compatible with a sustainable economy (see discussion under Q33 below). Third, through long-term support of the wood products industry in the region. Fourth, by providing opportunities to build tourism and recreation opportunities through enhanced viewsheds, trails, and other recreation assets.    Climate Partnerships / SDG 17, Partnerships for the Goals  The Washington Rainforest Renewal Project is part of a broader strategy of community-led conservation that incorporates improvement to the lives of local people (see discussion under Q33 below).","The Washington Rainforest Renewal Project is an important component to our multi-pronged strategy meant to transform the Emerald Edge, and effect the kind of cultural and economic change needed to overcome a global climate crisis. The Emerald Edge is struggling to recover from a century of overfishing and unsustainable logging that has eroded the ecosystem and the livelihoods of the communities that depend on it. Climate change and growing demands for resources threaten to further degrade this vital rainforest, which plays a critical role in reducing greenhouse gasses.    Our strategy is focused on supporting the Indigenous and local communities of the region who are dependent on these landscapes and who will steward and protect them into the future. This has led us to support the economic livelihood of communities and accelerate the development of sustainable, restoration-based economies in each landscape. For example, we have initiated and provided funding to sustainable business competitions (Washington Coast Works and Path to Prosperity) in the Emerald Edge and have an ongoing sustainable development initiative which focuses on bringing cohorts of business leaders and other community leaders together to work collaboratively to develop new sustainable development initiatives for their communities.    Much of our work across the Emerald Edge is pursued in partnership with Indigenous peoples who have lived here since time immemorial and have a deep connection to their lands and waters and knowledge to steward these places for current and future generations. The benefits of this work are well illustrated in the Great Bear Rainforest where a landmark agreement resulted in the increased role of Indigenous peoples in the management and stewardship of their ancestral lands and waters. In addition to the establishment of new protected areas, TNC worked with philanthropic, Indigenous and government partners to establish Coast Funds, which has supported communities as they increase stewardship capacity, strengthen community wellbeing and help transition the region towards a sustainable economy. As a result of the investment in Coast Funds, First Nations have conducted conservation work in 81 protected areas throughout the region, developed 26 protected area management plans and benefited from over 1,000 permanent jobs, all while leveraging the Coast Funds with additional investment at a ratio of nearly 3:1. We are currently supporting our First Nations partners to market and sell carbon offsets now in the Great Bear Rainforest. Additionally, for the past 10 years we have been working with three First Nations in Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island to implement their visions for a sustainable future, which would include the protection of the remaining old growth forests and a large carbon offset project we expect to implement by 2022.    A portion of credit sale proceeds will be directed to support our work with Indigenous partners in Washington and across the Emerald Edge, with the goal of demonstrating the value of investing in Indigenous-led conservation, as well as Indigenous-led carbon projects.

The U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities have proven torrefied material can be substituted for coal at the Boardman facility. The largest of the tests was a continuous burn that produced 270 megawatts of uninterrupted power generation, with only minor operational modifications. The Endowment has constructed of a torrefaction facility in John Day, Oregon that would partially fuel the facility. That facility will use forest thinnings from surrounding fire-prone forests as the fiber input, providing a much-needed market for the overcrowded, low-value material that is fueling catastrophic wildfires. Boardman is located atop the Grand Ronde Basalt formation which is approximately 40 miles from the Big Sky Carbon Project that recently demonstrated the potential for geologic sequestration of CO2. Using torrefied wood to fuel Boardman and using state-of-the art technology to capture carbon emissions in the underlying basalt formation could result in the continent’s first truly carbon negative baseload power source. The Boardman project has the potential for permanent removals through facility CO2 capture and injection beneath the basalt surface. Six Hundred thousand tons of annual removals could be anticipated assuming the power plant is operated at 15% capacity.

Such a determination would greatly increase the scalability of this project across the region and the nation.  ","Developing grassland carbon offset projects with Native Nations restoring bison","Fort Peck and Fort Belknap Reservations Bison Restoration Carbon Offset Projects under the Climate Action Reserve Grassland Protocol","www.fortpeckbuffalo.com","Avoided grassland conversion/ Soil improvement that results in additional carbon storage","This project would maintain carbon in the soil through avoided conversion of grasslands on communal bison pastures for two Native Nations in northern Montana. While the project is in its beginning stages, the potential for widespread scalability exists among 15 Native Nations in the Northern Great Plains, as does the potential to tie in improved management and restoration of grasslands in the future.  In 2019, WWF initiated a project to estimate the amount of carbon that could be maintained (i.e., stored) if the Fort Peck and Fort Belknap Reservations in Montana enrolled their communal bison pastures in the Climate Action Reserve’s (CAR) “Avoided Conversion of Grasslands” Protocol. Projects under this protocol require a permanent conservation easement that prohibits tilling and farming the property and a 150-year agreement with CAR to monitor the property and avoid undertaking activities that reverse the stored soil carbon. WWF, through our contractor NativeEnergy determined the expected offset production on 19,899 acres over the 50-year crediting period would be 563,842 Climate Reserve Tonnes (CRT). Fort Peck and Fort Belknap’s bison pastures are surrounded by areas already converted to cropland, and the pastures are also at risk of conversion because land use on these pastures is not permanently designated. Accessing carbon markets could provide permanence to conservation of tribal trust grasslands.  One limiting factor to the enrollment of these lands in a carbon protocol is the ownership structure of Native Nations’ communal lands. The National Indian Carbon Coalition has determined that there are no federal regulations governing carbon projects on tribal land. The American Carbon Registry’s Guidance for Carbon Project Development on Tribal Lands notes that BIA has not handled these issues consistently, and WWF believes this moment presents an opportunity to gain a determination from the agency.  As mentioned above, project participants would include the Fort Belknap Indian Community, Fort Peck Tribes, NativeEnergy, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as WWF. Payments from Microsoft for CDR would be used to maintain the financial solvency of the tribes’ bison programs, which help to conserve grasslands by maintaining large pastures for bison, maintain the genetics of the species by housing genetically pure bison and sharing them with other tribes across the U.S., and maintain the species itself—an important relative to the people of the Buffalo Nations.

Plains tribes manage some of the largest intact grasslands in North America and, as such, have a tremendous opportunity to maintain intact grasslands and grazing those lands in a way that ensures their sustained productivity. To that end, we work with tribal communities throughout the region to restore wildlife species that are culturally important and can also bring ecological and economic benefits. One aspect of our engagement with tribes is working with tribal bison programs to restore bison while generating greater community benefit including employment, increased revenue generation, and greater food sovereignty. In northern Montana, we work with the tribal communities of Fort Peck Reservation (Nakoda and Dakota Tribes) and the Fort Belknap Indian Community (Nakoda and Aaniiih Tribes).   Fort Peck Reservation encompasses approximately 2.1 million acres, 43% (906,126 acres) of which have been plowed, and 157,355 acres of which were plowed since 2009, so conversion and associated emissions are a genuine concern. The principal restoration activity is that of restoring bison, a native grazer and sacred relative of plains people, to tribal lands. Though it does not relate to carbon dioxide removal, the environmental implications of restoring bison are the following: Carbon sequestration from grazing intact native grasslands in the Western US can sequester up to an additional 0.02-0.22 tons CO2/acre per year. Intact grasslands store up to 50 tons of CO2/acre that has accumulated over decades or centuries. Plow-up, akin to deforestation, destroys habitat for everything from grassland birds to pollinators to microbial life in the soil. Bison are well adapted to climate extremes from cold winters and deep snow to hot, dry conditions; and therefore, are a resilient species in the face of increasingly erratic climate events. Their grazing behavior favors the flourishing of diverse native vegetation, can improve water infiltration, revitalize natural springs, and increase carbon sequestration. Restoring bison ensures the grasslands are protected from plow-up for crops, the biggest threat to grasslands and wildlife habitat in the NGP.  Previously these lands were d was used for grazing cattle that were sent to feedlots for finishing, which is also common practice for bison production. The bison will live entirely on the grasslands with surplus animals being humanely harvested instead of being sent to a feedlot. Average GHG estimates associated with feed production for NGP livestock that are sent to feedlots accounts for 11% of total livestock production emissions, which does not include land conversion emissions, all of which will be avoided with this project. In addition, it is estimated that 23% of all water consumption in the US goes to cattle-feed crops. Recent research found that during drought years, more than one-quarter of all rivers in the Western US are depleted by more than 75% during the summer, and irrigated cattle-feed was the largest use of more than half of these rivers. As we aspire to mitigate impacts of climate change, water is undoubtedly of great concern in the western US and the bison management strategy offers a sound alternative to traditional agricultural production for their tribal lands. Finally, range bison methane emissions are conservatively estimated to be 30% lower than commonly used range cattle methane emission rates. As methane is a potent GHG that has ~25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, potential reductions of methane emissions from establishing bison on this property further demonstrates the multi-faceted climatic mitigation offered through this project.  In terms of social sustainability WWF has worked with Fort Peck Tribes and Fort Belknap Indian Community to identify community values, needs and aspirations associated with the restoration of bison to ensure social sustainability of these efforts. In both communities WWF is funding the salary of bison program staff to add capacity in the development and delivery of new programs and services aligned with the expressed desires of community members. Since beginning this work WWF has supported progress on several fronts. WWF has worked with tribal partners to facilitate increased access of community members to the tribes communal bison herd and associated benefits by creating opportunities for tribal member to visit their bison herd, initiated affordable bison meat sales, increased donations of bison meat to tribal programs, increased awareness and access to tribal member bison hunts, increased bison program revenue generation from non-tribal hunts, and developed a culturally appropriate early childhood education bison curriculum. To measure progress on increasing the economic sustainability of the tribal bison program WWF is tracking increases in revenue generated from non-tribal bison hunts. To measures progress on community food security WWF is measuring the number of bison and the pounds of bison meat sold or donated to community members and programs. Overall WWF is working with our tribal partners to ensure that social sustainability is addressed on an equal footing to environmental and financial sustainability to ensure that conservation outcomes are valued and durable.  ","The National Indian Carbon Coalition has determined that there are no federal regulations of carbon projects on tribal land, and that carbon credit projects on trust lands that involve leases for sequestration or emissions-reduction activities will be reviewed under 25 CFR 84 (Encumbrances of Tribal Land) for tribal ownership and 25 CFR 169 (Rights-of-Way Over Indian lands) for allottee ownership. The American Carbon Registry’s Guidance for Carbon Project Development on Tribal Lands notes that BIA has not handled these issues consistently:  “Most land management actions and long-term commitments on tribal trust lands in the United States require Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) approval. However, BIA policy at the national level at this time remains unclear regarding carbon offset projects and what specific BIA approvals are required. Lacking a uniform national policy, some BIA regional offices have approved tribes entering offset projects, and/or provided documentation indicating BIA approval is not required for a specific project. There is limited precedent for the enrollment of tribal trust lands in the grasslands of the United States. To establish the eligibility of tribal trust grasslands the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will need to issue a determination on whether they will permit tribes with trust lands in the Northern Great Plains to participate in carbon markets and the associated agreements that would govern the trust lands that the BIA oversees (American Carbon Registry.

April 2018).”  Due to the lack of clarity around the eligibility of tribal trust lands in grasslands to participate in carbon projects WWF has only identified one Native Nation in the Northern Great Plains region attempting to establish a carbon project. It is WWF’s hope that through this proposed work we can help secure a blanket determination from the Bureau of Indian Affairs concerning tribal participation in carbon markets on trust lands in grasslands. WWF will subsequently raise awareness among the 15 Native Nations in our region concerning the opportunity that participation in these markets presents for the social, environmental, and financial sustainability of tribal efforts to conserve their lands and restore bison that the plains people consider their relatives.  American Indians are exposed to a variety of social, economic, and environmental injustices. They are among the poorest populations in the US, suffer from hyper-segregation, live in inadequate housing, lack access to educational and life resources other groups take for granted, have a higher incidence of a number of diseases, lack access to adequate medical screening and treatment, and have experienced a long historical process that reduced Native landholdings to a fraction of their “original” size. Taken together, these conditions of life have a strong impact on the average life course of Native Americans.    It might therefore be surprising to learn that Plains tribes manage some of the largest intact grasslands in North America – an enormous cultural, environmental, and financial asset. WWF has been working with tribal communities in the Northern Great Plains to restore bison populations and generate new economic opportunities to leverage these intact grasslands. Unfortunately, in the context of increased food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, remote tribal communities are struggling to access adequate resources to leverage bison as a critical source of nutrition because meat processing, storage, and distribution costs are prohibitive and COVID-19 relief funds are generally not directed to such efforts.    WWF is working with tribal partners in Fort Peck and Fort Belknap to support sustainable bison harvesting in response to food insecurity exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Large bison populations on reservations are contributing to mitigating impacts of COVID-19 but will not be preserved unless tribal bison programs are viewed as delivering ongoing value to their communities in a way that is socially, environmentally, and financially sustainable. Harvesting, processing, and storing bison for tribal communities helps to address food scarcity while demonstrating a tangible value to the community and creating an opportunity for tribal members to reconnect with the bison. For example, the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana recently harvested 6 bison that produced 1,700 pounds of meat that was distributed in packages of stew meat, ground meat, or roasts to 208 senior citizens and 456 reservation households, impacting an estimated 1,386 tribal citizens. In most cases the bison herds in WWF’s tribal partner communities have grown to the maximum number of bison that the grassland pastures on which they graze can be sustained. Bison thrive when provided with ample grazing and water, and the herd must be reduced by 25-30% annually to maintain constant numbers and to ensure that the herd does not threaten the long-term sustainability of the grasslands.  WWF and our tribal partners are creating a roadmap to achieve sustainability while addressing the immediate food insecurity needs intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The opportunity that Microsoft could offer for Native Nations to access carbon markets would provide another avenue to bolster the sustainability of their efforts to achieve food sovereignty while restoring a sacred species and conserving the vast grasslands that they steward and call home.

Partner Organisation: One Carbon World Limited","VCS CCB Certified Forest Plantation Project in Eastern Uruguay","""Guanaré"" Forest Plantations on degraded grasslands under extensive grazing","n/a",,"The project comprises a total of 20,877 hectares of land which had previously been under extensive grazing by beef cattle. On this area forest plantations were established to yield high-value, long-lived timber products, to sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and to improve soil quality.     The forests were based mainly on Eucalyptus grandis and to a lesser extent Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus dunnii, Eucalyptus maidenii, Eucalyptus tereticornis and Pinus taeda plantations in 22-year rotations, managed with pruning (to a minimum height of 12 m) and two to three thinning operations, to obtain knot free, high-diameter logs suitable for saw-milling and veneering. Project start date was on the 24th April 2006 and plantations were completed by year 5 of project (2011). Forests will be replanted after clear-cut harvest. All practices follow FSC standards for sustainable forest management while enhancing biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests. Moreover, the project generates income and job opportunities for local communities in rural areas of Uruguay. The planted forests are removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in different carbon pools (living aboveground and below-ground biomass, soil, litter, non-tree vegetation and dead wood).     The project was proposed by Guanaré SA (hereinafter Guanaré) on behalf of itself and Guanaré AARL, which are the owners of the land. Guanaré’s main activity is the implementation of livestock-forest-environmental projects on purchased land. All activities related to forest investments, marketing and management of Guanaré are implemented by a local company (Forestal Atlántico Sur SA, hereinafter FAS), through contractual agreement. FAS was established in 2005, and its partners are highly experienced in managing forests. All properties of Guanaré are legally owned and are covered by deeds duly registered with the National Records. There are no conflicts related to tenure or use rights over the land affected to the project or its products. Carbosur Ltda. is the consultant in charge of developing the carbon component of the project. It has a contractual agreement with Guanaré to develop and manage the carbon project.

","Yes","Not applicable (I answered yes to Q24)",,,,"Verra (VCS)",,,"CCBA","n/a","n/a","Biodiversity preservation: The establishment of forest plantations designed to preserve high biodiversity value areas (such as native forests, wetlands and low areas under grassland) has proved to be effective in Uruguay. Since largescale forest planting started in the 1990s, several surveys (mostly conducted by independent scientists on behalf of forest companies) have found a proliferation of birds, frogs, and mammals, some of which had been considered as extinct or endangered. These studies also found  at least three new species (two birds and one frog) which had never been reported before in the country. One of them is a case of a completely new species. The project activity would produce similar impacts.     Hydrological cycle: It is well known that planting trees on a grassland site usually causes a reduction in the runoff and an increase in the evapotranspiration. This might cause some competition for water with other users (e.g. cattle farms located downstream in the watersheds, hydroelectric power generation, and water for human consumption). Some studies (e.g., Silveira et al., 2006) have shown that this effect is not significant in Uruguay at the medium-size watershed scale (due to high precipitation). At the micro-watershed level, there might be some problems, which can be minimized by plantation design (e.g. by limiting the extent of forest plantations in a watershed). The project will leave at least 35% to 40% of the land area unplanted, which will greatly reduce the hydrological effects, as compared with a more common 25-30% of unplanted area. In addition, since most of the project area flows into rivers with relatively high flow rate, no significant downstream effects are expected. Any potential impacts on the hydrological cycle processes will be minimized by:   - the design of plantations, which will occupy only approximately 60% of the land area owned by Guanaré, avoiding sensitive areas; and  - the fact that the annual rainfall, and in particular during the spring-summer period, when usually water deficits occur, has been increasing over recent decades, and is expected to continue in the future, thus offsetting the expected decrease in runoff.     Given the fact that soil erosion will be controlled and that a minimal amount of agro chemicals will be used every 22 years, no negative impacts on water quality are expected. All watercourses in the project site will be continuously monitored. Proper corrective measures will be taken in the case of detection of pollutants above pre-project levels.    Soils: The area where the project will be implemented has an incipient process of soil erosion caused by overgrazing. This process may be accelerated due to climate change through the effects of an increased frequency of both droughts (and, in consequence, of overgrazing) and intense rainfall (leading to higher water erosion). In addition, the site has suffered from degradation due to nearly 300 years of extensive grazing by beef cattle and sheep, evidenced by a decrease in the content of organic carbon in the soils. The implementation of the project activity will result in an effective protection of the soil against erosion and in a reversion of the degradation by building up soil organic carbon. Soils will be disrupted only once each rotation cycle and site preparation will be based on strip tillage, with strips oriented perpendicularly to slope direction, and use of glyphosate herbicide to minimize the exposure the soil to erosion agents. The tree vegetation will completely protect the soil and at harvest, bark, leaves and branches will be left on the ground, thus minimizing any negative impacts of erosion by rainfall and soil degradation by harvesting machinery.    Use of chemicals: The project will use a limited amount of certain chemicals during site preparation for plantation; this is, only once every 22 years. These products include:     - Herbicides for site preparation: Including glyphosate, oxifluorfen and others, all of them properly registered and allowed by law in Uruguay. All these products will only be applied selectively (only when and where they are needed) and avoiding excessive rates. Adoption of safety procedures will minimize problems related with herbicide handling and spraying.     - Insecticides for ant control: ants are a major problem in newly established plantations in Uruguay, and they must be controlled in order to obtain a successful plantation. The project will use fipronil and eventually other products recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture (MGAP). These products are used in localized applications (e.g. they are not overcast) and in small rates, and only during site preparation and the first weeks after plantation. Adoption of safety procedures will minimize problems related with insecticide handling.     - Fertilizers: only limited amounts of starter fertilizers will be applied. Phosphorus is highly deficient in the project site soils, and application of phosphate localized at one side of each seedling ensures proper establishment. Average rate will be 100-150 g of P-rich fertilizer per seedling (between 1000 and 1100 seedlings/ha). Fertilizer will also have small amounts of nitrogen. In some cases, and according to soil analysis, small rates of potassium could be added, as well as some micro-nutrients needed to correct deficiencies.    Risk of forest fires: In compliance with national regulations, Guanaré has implemented an extensive plan to prevent forest fires. There are many preventive activities such as: i) establishment of a network of firebreaks surrounding forests blocks with an area not larger than 50 ha; ii) the introduction of cattle in early stages of the forestation for maintaining short and green pastures, thus reducing the volumes of fuel; iii) permanent surveillance of the project area, particularly at times of medium to high risk of fire; iv) burning as a possible technique for cleaning fields is particularly excluded; vi) warning signs with risk of fire are placed next to forest sites; vii) transit of non-authorized hunters, hikers or campers is forbidden; viii) fire extinguishers must be available in vehicles (including tractors) that circulate in the property. The risk of fires in commercial forests plantations in Uruguay is very low due to reduced population density and a very humid climate. Normally forest fires in Uruguay only occur in summer in the coastal areas of the South and Southeast of the country, associated with the tourism activity. In spite of prevention activities, fires can happen. In that case, equipment and staff (own and contracted) is ready and trained for firefighting.  ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","No","The project's FSC and highly regarded CCBA accreditation (of which only 46 validated projects exist globally at 08/13/2020) ensures all workers rights and local community interests are embedded into the project and that biological diversity is preserved and enhanced.    The project also includes important ecosystems such as very high biological wealth measured through birds assessment and monitoring, and rare or not common species included in the international list for conservation maintained by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).    After the afforestation project is fully launched, there will be an increase in flora and fauna species, and the project will implement afforestation activities through scientific and rational allocation methods, without burning, cutting or harvesting native forests.  The implementation and maintenance of buffer zones between forest plantations and native forests of more than 20 meters, will allow the development and, in some cases, the improvement of pastures. These pastures are habitat and biological corridors for many rare and endangered fauna species. In all the wildlife studies conducted by Guanaré, strict pasture species have been detected in forest lands where Guanaré implemented afforestation activities. The row site preparation will protect the existing vegetation as much as possible. Scientific and rational afforestation projects such as this can also favourably adjust the hydrological cycle, reduce drought and flood risk; promote soil nutrient cycle, improve local micro-climate and other ecological environments.","This project is certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC). The FSC is an internationally renowned program that sets the highest standard for responsible forest management. The FSC Principles and Criteria consist of a set of ten principles on how the forest must be managed to meet social, economic, ecological, cultural needs and rights of present generations without risking those of the generations to come. FSC has a strong focus on securing workers’ rights by incorporating core labour requirements into its system. These requirements include effective abolition of child labour, elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, respect of freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.    Creation of employment and fair wages are some of the main social benefits of the project. Typically, an extensive livestock production system employs 1.4 persons per 1,000 hectares. The Guanaré project is expected to multiply that figure by more than 10. Beyond an increased number of jobs, the project is expected to contribute to the development of the region and the country pursuant to the priorities defined by the Uruguayan government (promotion of small family businesses, increase in exports, eradication of rural poverty, incorporation of technology, increased nationally added value, development of new productive chains and geographic decentralization of development) as follows:    Promotion of small family businesses and creation of several job opportunities: As  mentioned above, the Guanaré project activity will generate several job opportunities, creating nearly 700 job positions . The vast majority of employees will be hired by contractors. The majority of the outsourced contractor companies currently working with Guanaré, are registered in Uruguay as “PYMES” (small and medium sized enterprises - SME), mostly family companies.    Internationally tradable products:  Outputs from the Guanaré project (wood and carbon credits) will provide access to national and international markets. Livestock meat is produced within Guanaré property by local cattle breeders and their product is also internationally tradable. Cattle breeding is an activity conducted by third-party companies, that rents the land not being used for forestry within Guanares property. This activity generates synergy with the forest and is not displaced outside of the area. Guanare has a policy to prioritize land rental to former cattle breeders in the area . As such, cattle farmers that have sold their land are not required to move to other places. This has an enormous social impact to communities. More than 70 farmers have benifited directly from this project.    Eradication of rural poverty: The main contribution of the Guanaré project activity to the eradication of rural poverty will be through the generation of high quality and stable employment, in a region of Uruguay with elevated levels of poverty. A study by Carámbula and Piñeiro (2006), demonstrates that forestry projects oriented to the production of high value timber, generates high positive impacts in the eradication of poverty in rural areas and reversing the process of internal migration to big cities. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, generation of job is not only for the forestry part, but also for livestock production within Guanare project site. As of March 2019, 362 indirect job positions had been created and 64 direct jobs.    Incorporation of technology: The project incorporates the best available and affordable technology for optimizing wood productivity and quality through the selection of seeds, site preparation, plantation, weed and pest control, forest management and wood harvesting and logistics, and achieving sustainability objectives. Guanaré has a program for applied research, continuously testing various practices in order to achieve continuous improvement over time and collaborates with other companies and public institutions in this regard.  All forestry workers in the Guanare project are incorporating the use of technology (silvicultural technology, GPS, drones, vehicles, tools), increasing their working capacity beyond this project.    Increased nationally added value to forestry products: Guanaré project will produce timber that can be used for high-value products. As discussed above, currently there are no wood industries located within a reachable distance from the project site. However, the presence of Guanaré and  other similar initiatives in the area  also seeking carbon finance (GFP, Weyerhaeuser and others) may induce  future  establishment of industries in the region. And even in the case that no industries are developed, the saw logs and veneer logs produced by Guanaré could be exported through Montevideo harbor at prices which will be higher than those that could be obtained by selling pulpwood, which is the traditional wood product exported from Uruguay. In addition, the forest management adopted by Guanaré would increase the amount of carbon sequestered by trees, thus increasing the carbon embedded value in wood products.     Development of new productive chains:  Guanaré forest plantation may contribute to promote the establishment of industrial investments in the area. In 2018, the government of Uruguay has signed a contract with a foreign company to establish the third pulp-mill in Uruguay. If all conditions are met, the plant will be established in the central zone of Uruguay, close to the Guanaré project area. The development of this new plant is only possible given the development of the forest sector in that region of the country. E. grandis has been established and managed for high-quality timber, and the reasonable market destination could be Rivera/Tacuarembo (sawmill) or Montevideo (harbor).     Geographic decentralization of development: The Guanaré project will bring about a number of socio-economic benefits to the surrounding area, which is currently one of the least developed areas in the country. This would create a development pole away from Montevideo and other areas which concentrate most of the economic activity in the country.    Improve local community’s well-being: Guanaré has implemented a program to support and assist local communities, public schools, and public entities (firefighters, police), with donations of various types. From material goods (firewood, tools, school supplies) to staff time (educational presentations in schools). Guanaré is committed to promote and enhance the well-being of the community.   ",,,,,,,,

In fact, it creates nearly 260 job positions during the agrarian phase and there are also approximately 70 local farmers whose businesses benefit from grazing beef cattle in the project's farms. Forest activity in Uruguay causes an increase in the number of jobs by a factor of 8 to 10 times compared to extensive farming activity.     Job quality is also improved, since forestry wages are typically higher than other activities in rural areas. There is a contribution to attenuation or reversal of the phenomenon of population migration from the project zone to urban and other areas of the country. This migration phenomenon from rural areas is at the core of the main social problems affecting the country. In addition, forest activity increases the baseline of job opportunities for women in activities such as nurseries, planting and pruning relative to cattle breeding production. This helps improve the stability of rural families. There is a tendency in the country for forestry workers to return home after each workday, which is a big improvement with respect to livestock, which strongly depends on the residence workers on farms, far from their families.     The development of services in the towns next to the project area is boosted due to project activity and the gross value of production per unit land area is expected to increase between 6 to 8 times compared to extensive livestock farming.

The ethanol plant has been operational since the 1980s and produces 350 million gallons of ethanol each year. Before the BECCS project was installed, the carbon dioxide resulting from the ethanol fermentation process was being released into the atmosphere. The feedstock for the ethanol plant is non-food grade corn, mainly from surrounding farmlands in the central Illinois region.     The BECCS project has been initiated by the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC) and its more than 40 associated partners, including Biorecro. First injection operations began in November 2011 and the project has since been operating and expanding in multiple phases to its current annual volume of 500 000 - 1 000 000 tCO2/y, depending on annual operational variations.     The BECCS facility has a dedicated compression and dehydration facility, which removes water from the biogenic CO2 stream and then compresses the dry CO2 to a liquid-like dense phase. The compressed CO2 then travels through a mile-long pipeline to the wellhead where it is injected deep into the Mount Simon Sandstone saline formation at a depth of more than 2000 meters, where it is expected to be permanently stored for millions of years. The Mount Simon Sandstone saline formation is the thickest and most widespread saline reservoir in the Illinois Basin and one of the most significant carbon storage resources in the United States.

"CarbonCure Technologies Inc.",,"Unlocking 500Mt/year of scalable, cost-effective, permanent CDR credits in concrete","CO2 Utilization in Concrete Production","www.carboncure.com",,"CarbonCure was founded in 2012 in Halifax, Canada, with the vision of setting the global standard for low carbon and circular concrete production, and is on a mission to reduce 500 megatonnes of CO2 annually by the year 2030 using its carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. CarbonCure uniquely offers permanent net-negative CDR credits on a lifecycle basis, which are highly credible, science-based and verifiable, by leveraging transparent data streams. CarbonCure’s technology is arguably the most scalable carbon utilization solution available today, with nearly 300 licensed plants and representing ~90% of global CCU projects; however, there are ~124,700 concrete plants globally which have not yet installed the technology, so the growth potential is enormous. Ongoing scaling advantages are attributed to its economic value proposition, strategic partnerships/investors, capital efficient model, seamless process retrofit, and integration with regulations, supply chains and complementary low CO2 solutions. CarbonCure’s technologies consume post-industrial CO? into concrete, where it becomes chemically (and permanently) converted into a mineral. CarbonCure is in high-growth mode and is executing on its scaling plan; a Microsoft purchase of CDR credits can dramatically accelerate that pathway.     The project will be led by CarbonCure (CDR technology provider), with partners across the value chain, including CO2 suppliers who capture gas collected as a by-product of industrial processes (industrial gas from merchant CO2 suppliers or biogenic CO2 from ENGIE), concrete producers who install CarbonCure’s technology in their plants (site of CO2 utilization), and end users who build construction projects with the concrete (site of CO2 permanent storage). To date, more than 6 million cubic yards of concrete have been produced, and 80,000 tonnes of CDR credits, have been generated by 234 concrete plants. CDR credits are quantified using the Verra (VCS) protocol, and all of the data required to generate the CDR credit is tracked in real-time using a custom Carbon Traceability app.     CDR credit revenue generated will be shared between CarbonCure (to offset technology costs) and the concrete producers to: 1) accelerate adoption of the technology at more plants, 2) increase the volume of concrete produced using the technology, and 3) maximize cement reductions - all of which create additional CDR offsets. A multi-year Microsoft CDR credit purchase could dramatically accelerate both the capital injected into the carbon removal space and the volume of future CDR credits generated, thereby accelerating the reversal of global climate change.    ","Indianapolis","Indiana","USA",9783258,12,210646,9572612,"1/1/2016","The captured CO2 is mineralized as calcium carbonate, a thermodynamically stable mineral that is abundant in nature (e.g. limestone, coral reefs). The expected timescale for sequestration is millennia (geologic timescales). Carbon as part of a carbonate is in a lower energy form than is carbon in carbon dioxide. Reformation of CO2 gas from carbonates requires an input of energy (e.g. thermal, chemical, electrochemical, etc). The necessary conditions to unlock the CO2 from the calcium carbonate are not met at any stage of the concrete life cycle including at the end of service life, therefore the mineralization of CO2 to carbonates is a permanent conversion and reversals are not anticipated.

","CarbonCure’s CO2 utilization technologies are retrofits to the concrete industry, and will employ industrial energy in a thermal or electric form at the capture step, result in fossil fuel emissions in the transport step and use electrical energy in operating the technologies at the concrete producer locations. An increase in the deployment of the CO2 utilization technologies do not represent net new activities but rather increases in existing elements of the supply chain (increased capture, increased transport, increased electrical demand at the concrete producer). The process emissions related to these are estimated to be about 6.3% of the amount of CO2 utilized (e.g. each tonne of CO2 captured, transported and utilized is accompanied by 63 kg of CO2 emissions). Technological evolution will drive the equipment operations to be more efficient while the development of alternative CO2 supplies (i.e. Engie’s biogenic sources of CO2) create opportunities to increase the energy efficiency of capture and reduce transportation distances. There are no other known forms of environmental or social harm related to the project. ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","The major non-CO2 co-benefit of the project is that the technology also provides freshwater and solid waste reductions. The technology usage results in net water savings as a result of reductions in cement, which avoids the use of freshwater required to produce cement (upstream), and a reduction in freshwater usage at the concrete plant due to wastewater recycling (downstream). The project water savings calculations are based on readily available industry average water footprint data for both cement and concrete. Since less cement is required to make the same amount of concrete, fresh water requirements are reduced when considering the overall material flow. Additionally, the wash water technology recycles solids that are often otherwise directed to landfills. A large portion of this is waste cement that could be redirected back into the concrete rather than being sent to landfills.     The project aligns with several other UN Sustainable Development Goals:  #4: Quality Education: CarbonCure prioritizes knowledge sharing and a commitment to educating its stakeholders in both developed and developing countries, which includes concrete producers and concrete end users (architects, builders, contractors) on how to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete, and hosts public webinars to raise awareness of the benefits of low carbon building materials which are often attended by students. CarbonCure also prioritizes education, marketing and awareness activities to encourage bolder decarbonization action by other industry players and governments, encouraging the adoption of carbon removal solutions today to accelerate action on climate change.  #6: Clean Water and Sanitation: freshwater savings are created through the use of the technology (see above)  #8: Decent Work and Economic Growth: The use of CarbonCure’s technology allows for concrete producers to realize production cost efficiencies, differentiate their products, and gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace over their competitors who have less green products; furthermore the sale of CDR credits injects additional capital into the carbon removal space which helps to accelerate market adoption.  #9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and #11 Sustainable Cities and Communities: Concrete made with CarbonCure’s technology is greener than standard concrete, and helps the concrete and infrastructure industries to meet their carbon reduction goals as they service the development of more sustainable cities and communities.   #12 Responsible Consumption and Production: CarbonCure’s technology recycles waste materials to make valuable products, which is an ecologically responsible approach to building a circular economy. Waste cement can be recycled and can be directed away from landfills and incorporated back into concrete production, thereby reducing solid waste.  #13 Climate Action: The technology offers net-negative carbon removal, which will help meet global climate targets and reverse climate change.   ","CarbonCure shares Microsoft’s values related to climate equity and environmental justice. The population is expected to grow by 22%, and 2.6 billion people will move to cities, by the year 2050. The global building stock is expected to double by 2060. As these communities develop, we need to collectively ensure that low-income countries and communities don’t bear the brunt of climate catastrophes and that they are able to transition to a low carbon economy. Concrete plants and heavy emitters are often in low income communities which often have unfavourable material recycling practices. When the local concrete producer adopts CarbonCure’s technologies the local communities benefit from cleaner air by recycling local CO2 emissions, reduced freshwater needs, recycled on-site grey water, and reduced solid waste. Moreover the low carbon concrete is used to build local construction and infrastructure projects that the community members get to live, work, and play in.     CarbonCure has internal policies around diversity, equity and inclusion, and is continuing to invest in the area to ensure our policies are best in class. CarbonCure’s gender and diversity representation on its team is well above industry norms, yet it remains an ongoing area of focus. CarbonCure strives for gender balance on its team, works to build a diverse and equitable workforce, and actively seeks to source products and services from diverse suppliers. CarbonCure is an active member of the Elemental Excelerator (EEx) community which shares best practices on anti-racism actions that can be taken today, sustained commitments into the future, and resource sharing to educate internal and external stakeholders in order to foster anti-racism inside and outside of the workplace.

We’re doing this not because we want to sell anything to farmers, but because we want to buy what we know they can produce.     Microsoft’s CDR payments will go directly to paying farmers who enroll to produce verified outcomes. Program and administrative fees are covered through investment structures with impact investors supporting other elements of the overall approach.     Carbon quantification is done using the USDA’s COMET Farm model, a peer-reviewed, freely available tool widely recognized as the premier method for calculating incremental carbon sequestration from specific on-farm practices in the US. This is backed up by statistically random on-farm sampling across soil zones to verify modeled outcomes.     Too often we see farmers mischaracterized in discussions about on-farm practice changes for reducing, capturing, and storing carbon – others might ask, “what if the farmer tills the soil and loses all the carbon?” We see it differently. We see farmers, like any business owner, wanting to understand risks, rewards, and tradeoffs before deploying limited resources in a complex environment. By pairing strong incentives and meaningful support for farmers to discover their own best practices, we believe we can help agriculture remain the thriving industry the world needs it to be.

This program only calculated and paid for removed carbon based on field-specific data applied by soil type for soil organic carbon changes.

C-Combinator is commercializing the technology that enables large scale (1/2 - 1 sq. kilometer) arrays 25 meters below the ocean surface.

With this valorization of the seaweed, each array can sink 6,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by sinking half the production for about $700 per tonne of earnings (not cost), so -$700 per tonne cost.  This is because companies earn a 6 year return of 57% on an investment of about $48M per array while they sink 6,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, per array, help regenerate life in the ocean, replenish fish stocks, and feed populations around the world.

"Charm Industrial, Inc.","None","Geological sequestration of bio-oil","Charm Industrial Bio-Oil Sequestration","https://charmindustrial.com/","Similar to BECCS, but we convert biomass to bio-oil and inject the oil into geological formations for sequestration.","Charm Industrial’s geological sequestration of bio-oil project began in March of 2020, when we discovered an opportunity to sequester CO2 in the form of bio-oil, an intermediary in our biomass-to-hydrogen process. In our novel process, bio-oil is produced through fast pyrolysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis) of waste biomass, then transported to an injection well, prepared for injection, and pumped underground. In the US these injection wells are typically EPA Class I Industrial Waste Disposal Wells or Class V salt caverns (https://www.epa.gov/uic/general-information-about-injection-wells). The process effectively takes atmospheric CO?, captures it in biomass, converts the biomass to a liquid similar to crude oil but with half the energy content (not economically useful or viable as a fuel), and injects it into rock formations that have securely stored crude oil for hundreds of millions of years.    Since the project’s inception, we’ve studied the constituents and properties of bio-oil alongside the constraints of wells and caverns to determine means of modifying the bio-oil for injection into geological formations. We filed a provisional patent documenting our findings and methods. We’ve also found a suitable well provider, and have kicked off the project of drilling our own injection well co-located with a future bio-oil production plant to limit transport costs and emissions. We are now working through regulatory approvals to classify fast pyrolysis bio-oil as a beneficial reuse material.    The project has been spearheaded by the company’s three founders, Shaun, Peter and Kelly. Shaun’s focus has been on the physical injection and its associated implementation. Peter has been focused on securing initial bio-oil supply, as well as economic studies and pricing. Kelly has been working on developing a larger plant for the expanded volume of bio-oil. If Microsoft pays for carbon removal through Charm, any profits will go directly to the expansion and scaling of our bio-oil production capabilities, helping us come down the cost curve towards scale economies. A long term offtake would also allow us to secure reasonable loans for plant construction of additional capacity, building towards significantly lower costs over time.","Wichita","Kansas","USA",20000,100,20000,32400,"10/5/2020","From a physics perspective, bio-oil is denser than water and brine, and does not decompose into gases or lighter liquids through any known natural process in these wells or geological formations. As a result, the appropriate monitoring is substantially less complex/intense than for supercritical CO? injection and geological storage (unlike bio-oil, supercritical CO? is buoyant on brine/water, and can naturally return to the surface).     That said, we will of course monitor for premature reversals using equipment traditionally built into the wells for leakage monitoring. There are both wellhead and annular monitoring systems that measure both flow and pressure inside the well. We will also maintain strict contracts with any well providers that prevent any of the injected material from being removed for any reason.     We would report reversals to customers who may have purchased them, along with any plans to remedy the issue, and would work with those customers to replace that tonnage that was previously sequestered with Charm’s bio-oil capacity, or equivalent.  ","No","No, the project will not be certified by June 2021 (please specify)","The project will not be verified or certified by June 2021 as we are completing our first injection sometime this year, while we understand the certification process takes about 12-18 months. We expect to pursue certification as soon as reasonably possible.",,,,,,"Possibly Puro.earth which has a faster process","This LCA is for the 2020-2022 removals and includes the end-to-end process from bio-oil production to injection, including transport. We do not include the emissions from biomass production, due to the biomass being a residue from agricultural activities. Every 1 tonne of bio-oil we procure contains 1.55 tonnes of CO2e. In the process we emit 0.36 tonnes of CO2e from transport and power usage, for a net sequestration of 1.19 tonnes CO2e per ton of bio-oil.     For this project’s LCA, a few notes:  1. “Bio-oil Production” carbon intensity is based on averages of public information about our bio-oil suppliers, including GREET LCA analyses approved by CARB.  2. “Transport to Well” carbon intensity is based on average rail fuel efficiency and the real transport distance from one of our bio-oil suppliers to one of our injection wells.  3. “Injection” carbon intensity is based on a maximum estimate of injection pumping power. Some wells are gravity-fed and require no power.  4. “Storage” carbon content is based on averages of public information about the typical bio-oil water and carbon content from our suppliers.  5. We’ve validated that (a) the bio-oil procured for this project is excess capacity, so we are not getting bio-oil that would have otherwise replaced fossil fuel burning, (b) the bio-oil procured for this project is produced from biomass that would otherwise have rotted, so we are not getting bio-oil produced from biomass that would have otherwise replaced fossil fuel burning.    For future scaleup we anticipate localizing the bio-oil supply chain, leading to a different life cycle analysis boundary that would begin with the waste biomass. Additionally, future projects will validate that the waste biomass entering the process does not have a legitimate alternative use that would displace fossil fuel burning.    We can provide:  1. Carbon intensity/lifecycle analysis from our bio-oil suppliers and injection partners.  2. Verification of receipt/transport of the bio-oil to our injection site from our bio-oil suppliers.  3. Verification of injection from our injection partners.  4. Lot-sampled bio-oil composition analysis to confirm carbon content.     See additional attached docs for a spreadsheet with the full math behind our life cycle analysis, as well as the Stripe Application we've attached (we were a selected vendor) which also gives additional color on lifecycle analysis.  ","CarbonPlan has completed an independent assessment of our novel methodology:  https://carbonplan.org/reports (look for their assessment of Charm Industrial on this page)","Class I and V injection wells are subject to strict standards for construction and operation, yielding extremely rare issues with leakage or damage. However, Charm would like to ensure that no negative environmental effects occur from the operation of its injections. In addition to each well’s redundant monitoring for pressure and flow, we plan to complement it with frequent inspections of both active operations and prolonged storage in inactive wells. We take additional precautionary measures in material selection for the well and associated equipment for proper compatibility with our bio-oil and run thorough testing on the bio-oil before planned injection. Quality control measures will help us ensure we have a consistent bio-oil and process as well.     There have been some reports of Class I injection wells causing minor seismic activity. This activity hasn’t been shown to do harm, and we look for sites where the area has relatively stable geological conditions or large-scale existing injection of brine via Class II injection wells that dwarfs our injection volumes. We continue to research the topic to understand the impacts more thoroughly.     Our process does rely on thermal energy for pyrolyzer start-up, potentially from fossil fuel sources, such as natural gas or propane. We seek to use zero-carbon sources throughout the process, such as the combusting of the solid biochar product or the gaseous products of the pyrolysis reaction.    We’ve included full carbon accounting in our life cycle analyses presented in the attached excel spreadsheet.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","There are a few co-benefits of our sequestration development efforts. One major one for Charm specifically, as well as the general low-carbon fuel economy, is the shared production of bio-oil. As we deploy plants to generate fast pyrolysis bio-oil for sequestration, the economies of scale will benefit the generation of bio-oil for our bio-oil-to-green-hydrogen gasification facilities as well. We can share in the innovation and optimization of those plants to accelerate the production of green hydrogen and syngas for fuel-cell vehicles, steel production and refineries across the country. This can be measured in the lower cost of capital that comes with risk reduction of scaling up multiple operational plants with diversified offtake opportunities.    Additionally, if we can bring a new growth industry to traditionally conservative Midwestern states, we could increase advocacy efforts for negative emissions and climate projects. This could secure key votes in the Senate for policies and resources aligned with negative emissions due to the added boost that a new, viable industry could bring to their local communities in the form of jobs and crop residue offtakes.","Charm Industrial, while founded in California, seeks to initially focus our bio-oil production and sequestration efforts in the agricultural communities of Kansas and Oklahoma, where both biomass and stable geological areas are favorable. The Midwest, once propped up by ethanol subsidies, has seen declines in its agricultural economy, and this will only worsen as climate change progresses. This provides an opportunity to lift up a struggling industry and community by providing a market for their crop residue and additional plant and construction jobs. It also creates the potential for new political support and alignment to future policy. Kansas and Oklahoma are traditionally influenced by oil and gas economics, but could see a new economic future where bio-oil production for negative emissions or hydrogen is economically aligned and job creationary. This should create a critical realignment of representation at the Federal and state level to accelerate lawmaking in favor of climate protection.",,,,,,,,

The land manager will pay for site prep and seeds to enable reforestation, at a 30% or more discount/acre over conventional approaches, helping subsidize the reforestation.    DroneSeed is proud of our partnership with the Tribal Nation that owns and cares for the vast majority of the proposed land, and is excited that some percentage of the proceeds from sales of carbon offsets to Microsoft accrue to the landowners seeking funding for reforestation post-wildfire. This financial engagement will have significant positive benefits for all parties, in accordance with DroneSeed’s principles. This approach is a strong asset, helping build relationships between all parties and demonstrating shared value.","Wenatchee","WA","USA",7324474,100,0,7324474,"10/31/2020","As with any reforestation ventures, there exist a series of risks that could threaten the permanence of the project. These are most commonly presented using risk categories and examples of each, as follows:     Financial  i.e. Financial failure leading to bankruptcy    Management  Illegal harvesting  Conversion to non-forest  Social  Changing government policies, regulations, and general economic conditions  Natural Disturbances  Wildfires  Disease/Insects  Other Episodic Catastrophic Events such as extreme weather events     For this project, DroneSeed will be relying on Climate Forward’s Reforestation Forecast Methodology, which has built-in mechanisms to ensure the permanence of ex ante credits issued resulting from reforestation activities. These include tonne-year accounting; an optional conservation easement or public ownership where management objectives can be demonstrated as being consistent with long-term maintenance of projected increases in carbon stocks; and conservative estimates in their carbon projections.      Methodology section 3.8.3 (https://climateforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Reforestation_Forecast_Methodology_v1.0.pdf) highlights the various design measures that have been included in the methodology to ensure elements of conservatism in their crediting procedures, thereby also helping to ensure permanence.      The carbon projections used in this Reforestation Methodology are expected to perform as predicted without decline. According to the methodology, climate change may be a factor in future carbon sequestration, but whether the effect will be negative, as in prolonged droughts, or positive, as with CO2 fertilization, lacks certainty and does not therefore merit any modifications to the published growth projections. Nevertheless, to ensure a conservative accounting approach (across the suite of projects) against the unlikely event of project site conversion and/or performance decline, a discount of 2 percent is applied to account for the potential abandonment of projects that do not have a conservation easement or are on government (non-secured) lands.","No","No, the project will not be certified by June 2021 (please specify)","FMUs will not be issued until one year post-planting following monitoring and evaluation; as such, the earliest this project would qualify would be Oct 2021",,,,,"None",,"Reforestation and afforestation don’t fit the typical mold or framework of a life-cycle analysis, as there is no need to decipher complex processes of material or energy flows in order to determine impact assessments. However, life-cycle assessment methods can be applied to assess the carbon footprint of such a process, and to further highlight how our innovative approach moves beyond the limitations and impacts of conventional reforestation methods.     To achieve this, a carbon footprint versus emissions sequestration model was put together to quantify specific impacts that pertain to the type of projects that DroneSeed seeks to scale. The scope and boundaries of this analysis capture the initial phases of the reforestation process, but rather than looking at conventional (nursery) seedling growth, transportation, and planting methods, a carbon footprint that is specific to the operations and transport of our drone-based aerial dispersal of seed enablement vessels has been determined. The other half of the analysis, of course, then involves looking at the net carbon balance of projects over time, providing a clearer picture of what the net emissions versus sequestration potential of such projects involves.        All projects utilizing the Climate Forward methodology employ a particular GHG Assessment Boundary, which delineates the GHG sources, sinks, and reservoirs that must be assessed by all project developers in order to determine the net change in emissions caused by a project. These include Primary and Secondary Effect Sources, Sinks, and Reservoirs. See additional information in Q29.","ICROA's best practices currently require ongoing management & verification. DroneSeed is working with Climate Action Reserve (CAR) on a new approach to certification called Climate Forward. Currently, CAR doesn't require measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) under the Climate Forward approach, which relies on Forecasted Mitigation Units (FMUs). While MRV is optional, a project could be designed to commit to annual MRV, something that is well in keeping with DroneSeed’s approach. DroneSeed typically requires access to project property for five years after the planting effort, ensuring continual monitoring of seed viability and growth. Please see question 37 for a deeper explanation of the Climate Forward (CF) approach to carbon certification.     While CAR doesn’t require ongoing MRV, confirmation bodies must confirm that all project activities and related documentation are in conformance with CF’s confirmation manual (https://climateforward.org/program/confirmation/climate-forward-confirmation-manual/) and with any related documents, such as the Reforestation Communities Data File, and that the estimated emission removals have been calculated accurately. The confirmation process incorporates both a desktop documentation review and a site visit assessment of the mitigation project. At later stages of project implementation, project developers can also opt to transition the project into the Climate Action Reserve’s carbon offset program under the Reforestation Protocol anytime and commit to further, well established, and ongoing monitoring, reporting, and verification requirements for ex post crediting.    Beyond the MRV provision dictated by the Climate Forward methodology, DroneSeed also requires in customer contracts that it be granted access to sites for up to five years for monitoring and reporting purposes. As a company both the customer and DroneSeed independently utilize fixed radius plots of 0.2 plots per acre throughout large acreages to monitor establishment and growth. The sampling method is blind as fixed radius plots used by the customer are unknown to DroneSeed.    ","In 2019, DroneSeed commissioned a third party to analyze emissions from transportation of workers to the field site, as well as use of generators to recharge batteries. DroneSeed determined that emissions totaled 27.02 tCO2e for every 2,470 acres reforested. The sequestration totals far outweigh these emissions.     Comparatively, typical reforestation using 1-2 year old trees grown in a nursery and transported to site by refrigerated transportation emitted nearly 3X this quantity per 2,470 acres due to the HVAC and significantly more trips required due to the larger size of the trees.     Lastly, for fire sites aged more than 1-2 years, site preparation to remove vegetation by manual scarification releases dust into the atmosphere which is contemplated by the CAR model.  ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","DroneSeed’s mission and technology applies to the following UN Sustainable Development Goals:  Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation  Goal 13: Climate action  Goal 15: Life on land    Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation    Watersheds are made up of forests. Water treatment and purification is performed by the trees and the soil. As climate change worsens, natural forest regeneration post-fire is in decline and burned forests risk state-shift permanently to scrubby grassland or ‘persistent early seral phase’. These scrublands don’t treat water to the same extent.    Goal 13: Climate action    DroneSeed’s mission is to make reforestation scalable to make a dent in carbon emissions. We exist because trees are the most cost effective method of carbon sequestration available. What doesn’t exist is the method to plant them at scale in rough terrain. DroneSeed utilizes heavy lift drone swarms that can fly to provide this--especially post-fire.    Additionally, millions of tons of carbon removed from the atmosphere per year requires immense amounts of physical space for the chemistry to occur and carbon to be stored. Unlike machines, trees are aesthetically pleasing, require no additional energy inputs, and they treat water. They also provide critical wildlife habitat, soil stabilization, and when harvested, can produce sustainable, low-carbon construction materials in the form of cross-laminated timber (CLT). Lastly, they also increase the shade of soils, increases water runoff and quantity available when not planted in excess.      Goal 15: Life on land    This goal calls for “Sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, halting and reverse land degradation, and halting biodiversity loss.”    Forest fires are increasing in frequency and severity, while natural regeneration is declining for the same reasons. The ability to plant forests at scale is the missing tool required to restore forests post-fire. DroneSeed technology provides this ability and has focused on restoring forests post-fire as its first use case.","As outlined in Question 14 on the Organizational Survey, DroneSeed approaches inclusivity in a number of ways, both externally, with those with whom we work, and internally across our hiring and management practices.     Externally, DroneSeed works hard to gain buy-in and understand the objectives of local communities to best help fulfill them. Our work with a Washington-based Native American Confederation of Tribes is one great example of this which has helped us codify and continue to improve our core principles relating to working with local partners.      Codifying Principles  DroneSeed’s approach to customers and communities has two principles and our partnership with the Native American Tribal Nation exemplifies these principles:  Principle 1: Land owner objectives. Community land managers own the land and our purpose is to serve them to get to the outcomes they desire.   Principle 2: Evangelize forest management beyond current land managers. We work hard to evangelize forestry to those who aren’t land managers and to help normalize the image of forestry jobs as “good jobs.” By establishing elements of a technology company in rural areas, closer to a resource base (i.e. forests), forestry provides pathways, role models, and incentives to retain rural community members or draw new members from the urban population into these often marginalized communities. While we don’t claim to be a silver bullet, it is our hope that by focusing not only on creating a technological approach to an old problem but also by emphasizing inclusive cultural practices we can be part of the effort to reduce the likelihood of stigmas associated with rural areas and outdated cultural norms inhibiting the opportunities of people from more diverse backgrounds.     This external effort ties strongly to our internal practices. As we launch in new places, we seek to hire our operations teams directly from the community; with entry level jobs requiring nothing more than a high school diploma and the ability to work outdoors, we are able to offer employment onramps to many people not previously part of the tech economy. As DroneSeed is successful, we are uniquely able to make a stronger connection to the community than ever possible before with good jobs that recruit local talent, invest and grow the talent, and keep them there year round. We can do this only because we are building better tools and a better process as required to scale for our mission. Our current partners have never had the opportunities to build these deeper relationships before and are very excited about the possibilities as shared in our Letter of Supports by The Arbor Day Foundation, CAR, and Basecamp.     At the corporate level, too, the company has intentionally focused on hiring a diverse team from the beginning so that we perform better, as well as are able to recruit future top talent from all walks of life without forcing that talent into exhaustive extra hours “as the first representative.” As a result of these efforts a wide array of diverse persons in sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity, and veterans have joined DroneSeed to serve land manager objectives and evangelize beyond. In April, 18 of 27 salaried persons at DroneSeed presented as non-white/Identified as LGBTQ/non-male. In senior leadership, 5 of 6 positions presented as non-white or identified as LGBTQ/non-male/veterans.    DroneSeed can always learn more and is interested in Microsoft’s feedback. We have taken a positive step forward by reimagining and defining ‘good jobs’ in forestry, and focusing on ‘serving land manager objectives’ and ‘evangelizing beyond’ in the local community at our first hangar in Seattle. We expect that to continue as we locate more hangars in the future, and are eager to continue our intentional growth in this area.",,,,,,,

It is the first and only regenerative grazing U.S. carbon project that will be verified to ICROA-approved standards. It can also be expanded to deliver an additional 7 million tonnes (please see ‘expansion’ attachment), enabling Microsoft to catalyze the first-of-its-kind verified carbon project in the U.S., and bring long-term stability and resilience to this ecosystem and communities that rely upon it.     How It Delivers CDR: The project sequesters carbon through increasing grazing intensity and increasing periods of rest and regrowth between grazing events. Healthier soils in grassland ecosystems that border Yellowstone National Park will help improve the Park’s natural buffer and critical wildlife corridors - part of the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. Healthy soils will also increase the viability of ranchers in the western plains.     History: Grasslands that once supported bison became home to cattle in the 19th century. The concomitant introduction of fencing lead cattle to graze select patches of grasslands without allowing for rest and regrowth of those grasses, leaving the region’s soils degraded. However, improved grazing practices build soil carbon and restore soil health, and ranchers are increasingly interested in being part of this change.     Participants and Their Roles: NativeEnergy’s role is developer of the project and manager of the carbon assets, as well as ongoing monitoring and expansion. WSE conducts rancher outreach and engagement and provides ongoing support to ranchers to develop and implement regenerative grazing management plans. The ranchers co-create and deploy improved grazing management plans over the 30-year project term, allowing soil carbon sampling and third-party verification throughout.     How Microsoft’s Payments for CDR Will be Used to Catalyze Change: This project provides upfront financing to cattle ranchers to acquire fencing and water infrastructure necessary to employ regenerative grazing practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it in soils. Upfront carbon financing overcomes initial barriers to adoption. Ongoing payments (per verified tonne removed from year six on) and the lasting benefits for ranchers sustain these beneficial practices for decades to come, along with a long list of other ecosystem and economic benefits for communities. The project establishes 20-year contracts with ranchers to employ regenerative grazing practices, each monitored, verified and reported on over the project’s life.     The project land is grassland managed for livestock grazing. The landowners are public and private entities. Participating ranchers own or lease the lands.","Billings and Bozeman","Montana","USA",1500000,100,6000,1494000,"5/1/2019","To achieve the certification level, this project will meet the Verified Carbon Standard requirements - which apply to all VCS AFOLU projects such as this one - to conduct a non-permanence risk analysis to determine a buffer contribution. Depending on the results of the non-permanence risk analysis for the project, a certain percentage of credits are set aside into Verra’s buffer pool to account for unintentional carbon removal reversals for any of the standard’s verified and issued credits. The greater the non-permanence risk of a project, the higher the number of credits a project must contribute to the buffer pool.  For intentional reversals, Verra requires the project proponent to replace verified issued credits in equal amount to those reversed.  NativeEnergy maintains its own reserve for this purpose.  At the project level, NativeEnergy has 20 year agreements with the land operators to maintain the project activity and 30 year statements of intent with landowners to keep the project area as grassland. For soil carbon sequestration in grasslands, the greatest threat to reversals is repeated tillage over multiple years. Our due diligence process for selecting project participants limits our exposure to participants who are likely to convert grassland to farmland for these unintentional reversals. Additionally, the project activity is expected to increase forage and subsequently the ranch productivity over time, reducing our long-term reversal risk.  We do not expect unintentional reversals as soil organic carbon is protected underground and published research findings link fire to increased soil organic carbon over the long-term. In addition, as a “grouped” project, all reversal risk is reduced by diffusion among individual ranches with independent decisionmaking and geographic dispersal.","Yes","Not applicable (I answered yes to Q24)",,,,"Verra (VCS)",,,,,,"The Montana Improved Grazing Project has a light touch. NativeEnergy works with ranchers who propose to us the practices and associated infrastructure improvements (fencing and water access) they believe will enable them to improve their grazing practices.

Thus, the project activity comes from those most knowledgeable about, connected to, and impacted by the land and its condition.    The negative environmental impacts are accounted for within the project documentation by calculating the baseline and project emissions associated with any increase in fossil fuel use needed to move the animals more frequently to achieve the project goals of increasing rest/rotation on participating ranches.

Boundaries are consistent with the USDA’s definition of the Common Land Unit (CLU). The CLU is used for all USDA statistics reporting purposes.    When a US farmer transitions to regenerative agriculture practices from conventional, coincident reductions in emissions almost always occur in their supply chain, with one exception. The one exception is if and when the farmer substitutes organic matter for synthetic fertilizer, and the organic matter (OMAD) is imported, and not originating from within the farm boundaries, there can be an incremental increase in fertilizer transport emissions. For this reason, Nori requires suppliers to report when OMAD is imported, where it comes from, the distance and mode of transport, and we account for any supply chain related emissions increase in our NRT quantification. Of course, when OMAD is being substituted for synthetic fertilizer, emissions are reduced because of the reduction in synthetic fertilizer use. As Nori accounts for OMAD transport emissions, but does not credit the project for synthetic fertilizer emissions reductions, the resulting GHG estimate is always very conservative.    For each project we ensure there is a net upstream reduction in GHG emissions before we qualify the project for listing. We don’t register the project if there is a likelihood of significant leakage.   If we completed a detailed LCA for all supply chain emission changes outside of the project boundaries, we are satisfied that it would result in an increase in net carbon removal. Therefore, our approach is most conservative. ","It is a requirement that all projects in Nori’s marketplace undergo independent 3rd party verification. As described in Appendix A.8 Nori’s design disaggregates quantification of carbon from the verification of input information. The former is conducted by an independent 3rd party carbon quantification tool, in this case COMET-Farm, and the latter is conducted by an independent 3rd party verification body that reviews the information provided by the farmer (Kelly Garrett) that is used in the quantification of carbon removals.   Suppliers are required to submit operational data once every year and must acquire 3rd party verification of this data no later than every three years in the project term.  The details of that verification are outlined in Nori’s Croplands Methodology document available at nori.com/resources/croplands-methodology. ","For projects complying with Croplands Methodology including Garrett farms, we do not anticipate any negative environmental or social impacts. When we generate our carbon removal estimates, we collect estimates of GHG impacts. For Nori projects, we collect fossil fuel information from suppliers to ensure and account for changes in associated emissions.For Garrett Farms, fuel use has decreased to implement these projects.  This is typical of almost every project of this type, as reduction in tillage means less operations of machinery, which leads to decrease in diesel use to run these machines. We do not expect emissions to go up in these projects, however we do collect this data and validate that emissions from fuel use are not increasing.  See Appendix D1","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","Yes","Adopting regenerative practices of cover crops and reduced and/or no till have been shown in peer reviewed literature to have several co-benefits: specifically around improving water stewardship, soil biodiversity and reduced erosion along with on average lower applications of fertilizer and crop protection inputs (i.e. pesticides and herbicides) reported in several case studies. Cover crops may also reduce runoff, which is and will be an important factor in risk mitigation for flood hazards, which have increased in the Midwest due to climate change and are likely to increase further as we continue into the 21st century.     Improving carbon levels in the soil (either by cover crop and/or reduced/no till separately or in combination) has been shown in peer reviewed literature to provide additional benefits in improving water holding capacity of cropland soils, making yields more resilient to drought, improving nutrient cycling - reducing need for additional synthetic nitrogen, which in turn improves water quality.    While these are estimates from peer reviewed literature that represent average effects relevant to the cropping regions we work with, specific field level co-benefits are possible to measure in project locations. These co-benefits are able to be quantified by watershed modeling parameterized by farm activity data and in-situ measurement for water quality, and on farm management data (including fertilizer, crop protection application rates, yields and soil samples) to provide the necessary raw data to quantify environmental co-benefits on water infiltration rates, reduced erosion, reduced inputs and more resilient yields. ","The vast majority of farmers in North America are family-owned small businesses that are integral to the success of small rural communities. Many of these communities are low-income and underserved in many ways including access to technology (e.g. broadband) and STEM educational programs. Additional revenues from these carbon removal projects will be beneficial to further bolster initiatives and increase employment. Additionally, agriculture has had formidable barriers to participate in carbon markets as the current markets are not designed to include carbon removal projects that are small in size.      Existing protocols developed by traditional carbon registries have been designed in such a way that makes them largely inaccessible to small businesses, small project developers, and small credit buyers. Nori’s marketplace is unique in that it is designed specifically for small and medium farm operators to have as much market power as the largest integrated agriculture companies. In order to see wide scale adoption of regenerative practices and to restore the soil health and quality of our food system, it is imperative that small and medium farm operators take part. It is not physically possible for the U.S. to get anywhere near the Paris Accord levels by 2030 without enrolling food and fiber producers to deliver this service. It costs significant upfront investment to switch from conventional to regenerative agriculture practices.

These carbon-rich sinking particles are supplemented with downwelling pumps which relocate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from near-surface to depth where it is less able to outgas to the atmosphere.   Reducing near-surface ocean dissolved CO2 enables higher partial pressure (pCO2) from atmosphere into the ocean (in-gassing); or at a minimum reduces the out-gassing pCO2, thus lessening the CO2 exchange from ocean to atmosphere.

"Project Vesta","n/a","Coastal enhanced weathering of olivine rocks to remove atmospheric CO2.","Project Vesta","www.projectvesta.org",,"Project Vesta emerged from think tank Climitigation - which existed to identify the most promising and under-funded CDR technologies. Coastal Enhanced Weathering (CEW) emerged from Climitigation’s process as a highly scalable and cost-effective method of permanent carbon capture which had attracted less than $5M in investment cumulatively over multiple decades.     Project Vesta aims to help reverse climate change by turning a trillion tonnes of CO2 into rock. We do this by harnessing the power of natural wave energy to accelerate the process of rock weathering, which has captured CO2 on earth for billions of years. The process - which is called coastal enhanced weathering (CEW) works by taking the volcanic green mineral olivine and spreading it as sand in high-energy coastal areas. There, wave action breaks it down and CO2 is removed. Breaking down the olivine using particle collisions (occurring because of  the natural energy of wave action) is critical to the energy-efficiency of this process.    Project Vesta is a non-profit organization, consisting of a group of scientists and entrepreneurs who came together to further the science of CEW with an open-source approach to enable global deployment. Our team comes from a diverse range of backgrounds, with each participant bringing unique skills and knowledge to the table. The group saw that while the basic science of CEW had been well established for years, there was little progress towards developing CEW into a mature technology.    Through our process, carbon is removed from the atmosphere as follows. When olivine dissolves in water, it shifts a chemical equilibrium from carbonic acid towards bicarbonate, which removes CO2 from the atmosphere. This bicarbonate is used by marine calcifying organisms in their shells and skeletons, ultimately being captured in limestone on the ocean floor.    Microsoft’s CDR payment will be used to fund the spreading of olivine in coastal areas. Specifically, the majority of the funds will be used to purchase olivine and transport it to deployment sites. In addition, there are costs of monitoring deployment sites and managing the overall logistics.    Coastal Enhanced Weathering has the potential to permanently remove gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year for $10 / tonne, once scaled. We must deploy more olivine projects to bolster the scientific case, prove logistical feasibility, and achieve economies of scale. Microsoft’s support of Project Vesta would not only pay for carbon removal, but would give this emerging technology the boost that it needs to become a mature solution.",,"CA","USA",1700017,100,0,1700017,"8/1/2021","We will monitor for premature reversal through geochemical analysis of ocean water ions to determine the rate and level of weathering and transfer of CO2 as carbonic acid to bicarbonate.

Mining: <1; Crushing & grinding: 7; Transportation: 40; Spreading: 3. This results in 50kg CO2 emissions / tonne olivine deployed. We assume 1 tonne of CO2 captured / tonne of olivine deployed. This is below the maximum CO2 removal efficiency of 1.25 tonnes CO2 / tonne olivine in order to be conservative. This results in a 95% efficiency.     The LCA excludes emissions associated with ancillary activities such as the manufacture of sensors used to measure carbon dioxide removal. These are not included because at scale they will be insignificant in size and will not meaningfully impact net removal volume. Out of an abundance of caution, Project Vesta plans to include all known ancillary activities in a future version of the LCA.    Sensitivity analysis shows that the process remains efficient even in highly pessimistic scenarios.

As currents drift the assemblies through ideal growing locations in the open ocean, the kelp grows rapidly by absorbing sunlight, CO2 and nutrients. After a predetermined period a mechanical/biological timer inside the buoy is set to eliminate positive buoyancy. At this point, the entire microfarm achieves negative buoyancy and sinks to the deep-sea floor. Over time, sedimentation occurs and sequesters the kelp’s embodied carbon for a projected period of 1000 years.    In early 2020, we developed a moored prototype kelp system to confirm that kelp can grow on vertical lines. With Palo Alto-based engineering consultants Function Engineering, we conducted a feasibility study and built a sensitivity model to determine cost-driving factors. We are verifying the evolution of the microfarms’ environmental conditions using ocean circulation models and numerical trajectory frameworks. Our oyster hatchery is fully permitted to grow kelp at scale, and we are working with Function to determine an appropriate kelp hatching scaling model.    In December 2020, Running Tide will launch an offshore experimental deployment of 1600 microfarms. The purpose of this experiment is to test that we can grow kelp offshore, and to determine if we can sink the assemblies to a depth of 1000m, at which point we can infer sequestration given appropriate oceanic conditions. Once deployed, these assemblies will drift for 7-8 months, accumulating kelp biomass and feeding temperature, salinity, light-level and nutrient availability data to the development team onshore. We will use this data to optimize future deployments for carbon sequestration, and for third party verification. In July 2020 we will launch a Verification Trip to collect a subset of these buoys for genetic sampling and to conduct sinking tests.     Along with Marty Odlin, CEO, key participants include:   Dr. Margaux Filippi, Data Scientist and Oceanographer; Max Chalfin, Data Scientist II; Phil Connaughton, Software Engineer; Philipp Werminghausen, Software Engineer; Eben Sargent, Lead Engineer; and Sam Woolf, Production Engineer.    Microsoft’s payments will be used to buy raw materials, seed kelp lines, and send vessels out to deploy the microfarms. Most importantly, these contracts will prove product market fit and allow us to approach banks to finance our kelp hatchery expansion, which we’ve identified as the key bottleneck to scaling our efforts.    Our learnings from this experiment will inform our December 2021 microfarm deployment, which will sequester 20,000 tons of CO2 by October 2022.    ","Portland","Maine","USA",10000,100,0,10000,"12/15/2021","Running Tide will deploy extensive suites of instruments to monitor the microfarms and measure the evolution of macroalgal carbon throughout its life cycle. These will include sensors to measure dissolved carbon around the microfarms, which will allow us to detect carbon leakage.    First, the proof-of-concept will include two experiments: a near-shore, coastal experiment consisting of moored microfarms and heavily-instrumented tethered buoys, as well as an offshore experiment that will include, among others, several drifting microfarms with tethered, instrumented buoys. This will enable us to understand and predict the variations in biomass growth with environmental conditions.  Second, to verify the sequestration process, Running Tide intends to deploy instruments to monitor the evolution of the sunk kelp, within the constraints of the extreme deep-sea environment. Properties to measure include dissolved carbon here as well. Moreover, by collecting samples of decomposing kelp and of sediments, we hope to investigate the efficiency of kelp burial into sediments and verify that there is a minimal amount of dissolved carbon recirculating into the seawater. In the event that all of the macroalgal carbon dissolves, it will remain sequestered within the ocean interior for about 1,000 years.

As they disperse in the ocean we will:  Observe what fraction of instrumented beacons advect to the intended sinking region over the abyssal plains (as opposed to, e.g. sinking prematurely or beaching onto shore). We will project this fraction onto the total deployed (including uninstrumented) assemblies.  Use this GPS data to refine our drift models to select superior deployment locations on an ongoing basis  As the kelp assemblies advect into open waters, we will physically recover a representative subset onto our research vessel. These recovered assemblies will be analyzed for kelp growth and kelp carbon content as a function of environmental parameters experienced by the assembly. We will project these findings onto the total deployed assemblies. For the unrecovered assemblies, we will use environmental data from satellites to interpolate or extrapolate the results and estimate the unrecovered kelp biomass.  When the kelp assemblies enter their sinking phase, a statistically significant subset will be equipped with pressure-release depth sensors. These instrumented assemblies will track their descent into the ocean and, after a time, release from the kelp and float to the surface where they will broadcast their findings back to Running Tide via satellite. We will observe what percentage of these assemblies survive to their communication phase and to what depth they sink, and project these findings onto the total quantity of deployed assemblies. (It will be assumed that any assembly that sinks below 1000 m will sequester its carbon)  This data will be used to model the total quantity of carbon delivered to the ocean floor. We will deliver to stakeholders our analysis of this data, along with the raw data itself so that our analysis may be externally audited.  ","Unlike other marine geoengineering approaches that can alter food webs and deoxygenate sections of the ocean, our solution has minimal negative environmental impacts. Our approach requires very few industrial processes and therefore emits a minimal amount of emissions because the primary drivers are photosynthesis and ocean currents.     Foreseeable environmental impacts include greenhouse gas emissions from the seed cultivation and transportation, which can be minimized through the use of renewable energies; sourcing and littering of non-kelp materials from the assemblies into the open ocean, which can be mitigated through green manufacturing techniques and the use of sustainable and biodegradable materials; and potential effects of releasing large masses of algae into the deep-sea floor. By targeting anoxic abyssal plains, we expect the macroalgal carbon to decompose into sediments, as opposed to being redistributed into the seawater by bioturbators. We do not expect methanogenesis to occur as we are targeting sinking sites with low microbiome. We do not foresee the release of massive amounts of kelp to affect the food chain, whether at the surface or on the seafloor, as macroalgal carbon export to the deep sea is a process naturally occurring on large scales [Dierssen et al, 2009] and macroalgae is part of the diet of some benthic animals [Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016].     As noted above, direct fossil fuel consumption arises from our kelp seeding facilities (powered off Maine’s Portland-area electric grids) and diesel powered ocean going vessels. Our modeling of this power consumption indicates that fossil fuel associated emissions, when amortized over sequestration assemblies, represent 0.15% of the carbon we sequester.

Blue Carbon habitats have been experiencing a staggering decline worldwide due to human activities, affecting not only the prevalence of natural carbon sinks but also altering the carbon cycle in the ocean. The large-scale cultivation of kelp will not only help sequester carbon, but also partly restore a naturally occuring carbon export to the water column. The microfarms will also provide miniature offshore habitats, replicating, for example, drifting mats of Sargassum algae.  ","At scale, we intend to locate our cellulose floatation factories in rural Maine, generating hundreds of jobs in the manufacturing sector. These regions have experienced devastating economic decline in recent years with the collapse of local industry, and as a result are under-resourced and not typically represented in conversations about building an environmentally just future.

"SilviaTerra LLC","There are no additional partners involved in this proposal beyond those described in Question 15 of the Organization Survey. That answer is reproduced here for clarity:      SilviaTerra is offering a vertically integrated solution to this RFP, meaning we are both the project developer and the credit broker/marketer. We engage directly with the certifier(s) and orchestrate all elements of field measurement, verification, etc.     There are three notable categories of partners and subcontractors engaged in our projects.    1.) Landowner aggregators. Each of our carbon projects has several landowner participants (see full explanation in the Project Survey). Landowner aggregators are entities that engage in our projects as a single participant, but in fact represent the aggregation of several smaller landholdings. This is allowable and desirable, because it increases the breadth of potential project participants. Such aggregators are required to make all the same attestations as any other participant in the project, in particular that they have legal authority over the management of the land.     2.) Verifiers. These are third-party, independent verifiers engaged in accordance with the verification requirements of the certification bodies. The specific verifier entities for our projects in this RFP response have not been identified, but will meet the full requirements of the certifiers and will have regionally relevant forest experience.     3.) Consulting foresters for ground measurements. The carbon methodology underlying our projects requires field measurements to refine its remote sensing estimates of carbon stocks and landscape activity. SilviaTerra contracts this work with regional third-parties that meet our standards for expertise, professionalism, integrity, and cost-effectiveness.   ","Microsoft pays US landowners to accelerate forest CDR","SilviaTerra Natural Capital Exchange (NCAPX)","https://www.silviaterra.com/ncapx-story-pa",,"The Natural Capital Exchange (NCAPX) is a data-driven forest carbon marketplace that leverages innovative technology to include every acre of forest in carbon removal. This mechanism bridges operational, acre-level forest management with holistic, landscape-level CDR.     American forests already remove vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year--US above-ground forest biomass carbon has increased by about 450 million tons annually over the last 30 years.* NCAPX pays landowners to accelerate this rate of CDR across the forested landscape. By lowering the amount of harvest activity on their properties for a 1-year project period, higher volumes of CDR are enabled; as this program runs year over year, the average age of forests increases relative to business as usual. The net result is an additional increase in total forest biomass across the landscape, resulting in durable additional removal of carbon from the atmosphere.    The backbone of this marketplace is our high-resolution, nationwide forest inventory called SilviaTerra Basemap, developed in collaboration with Microsoft ‘AI for Earth’. Using remote sensing, the baselining and performance in this project are fully algorithmic and executed on an acre-by-acre basis across the entire project area, bringing a transformational level of transparency and precision to the resulting credits. These methods also dramatically lower the measurement and monitoring costs, opening NCAPX participation to landowners of all sizes, including family ownerships under 100 acres. This democratization of access has been demonstrated already in the NCAPX pilot program in Pennsylvania, funded by Microsoft and concluding this summer. Broad access to carbon markets advances climate equity, aligns rural communities with forest conservation, and reduces leakage.     NCAPX is expanding to commercial scale in 2021 across eleven states in the US Southeast. Large landowners have signed LOIs to bring over 6 million ton-years of carbon to the market, and regional partners stand ready to engage small family landowners. In 2022 and beyond, the NCAPX program will expand to all forest types in all US regions. Microsoft’s CDR payments will be used to immediately and verifiably increase the rate of forest CDR on the landscape. High quality, US-based, certified carbon credits will result, representing real change that will have already been accomplished.     Each 1-year period of NCAPX is technically a separate project. This RFP submission, however, refers collectively to the next 10 years of NCAPX projects, presenting them as a multi-year procurement solution for Microsoft.         *EPA, Inventory of U.S. GHG Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2018  ","Atlanta","GA","USA",10000000,100,375000,36750000,"4/1/2021","NCAPX is a “payment upon delivery” project--no payments are made to project landowners until carbon has been verifiably and transparently accounted for as removed. When an NCAPX project is completed, additional carbon is credited and paid for, and the project and project impact are complete. There are no going-forward costs or liabilities for any party. No buffer pool or other assurance mechanism is required, and reversals beyond the one-year time horizon do not exist once the ton-years are delivered. (The document attached to Question 38 below, in reference to the topic of durability, explains the connection between this finite 1-year term and durable impact.)    Instead of reversals, the issue to consider is failure to deliver as contracted. As mentioned above under Question 20, Microsoft’s purchase of carbon will entail signing a purchase agreement that represents a claim on delivery of the carbon, i.e. the collective contracts signed by the landowners. To protect against non-delivery by landowners, an NCAPX project allows every participant to generate an incremental percentage of carbon credits above their contracted volumes (subject to their property’s ability to do so), which can then be sold to cover non-delivery. The inclusion of many landowners with geographic dispersion in one project also inherently provides additional protection against non-delivery. Finally, the landowner contracts contain penalties for non-delivery including sanctions against or limitations on future NCAPX participation.     Ultimately, at the time carbon is paid for, it will have been delivered and no long-term liability will remain for the buyer.  ","Yes","Not applicable (I answered yes to Q24)",,,,"Verra (VCS)",,,,"n/a","n/a","The carbon methodology underpinning NCAPX projects is conservative in the sense that it doesn’t take credit for the positive GHG impact of the deferred harvest activity (i.e. delayed and/or reduced fossil fuel usage) in the project.     NCAPX projects also avoid harm to landowners in several important ways. First, there is a long history of social inequity in agriculture (writ large) that this project avoids by including landowners of all types and sizes, including ones that have been historically excluded from market participation. (See more discussion on that topic in our attachment to Question 10.) Additionally, NCAPX avoids locking landowners into long-term contracts that might hurt or disadvantage them in the future. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the future, long-term (e.g. 100-year) contracts run the major risk of turning out to be suboptimal for landowners--the term is simply too long to know in advance. NCAPX 1-year contracts avoid this problem, and allow landowners to integrate carbon sales into the year-over-year, economically optimal management of their forest assets.     The project has de minimis risk of encouraging deforestation or other forestry-related emissions increases. Any such risk would come from leakage of harvest activity to other forest areas around the globe, which is incorporated into the calculation of removals; our discussion of activity-shifting leakage above (in the supplemental material on project methodology) suggests this risk is minor.   ","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","Yes","By participating in NCAPX, Microsoft not only achieves meaningful co-benefits, but more importantly, promotes the development of a data-driven platform through which all benefits from forests--water purification, wildlife habitat, sustainable rural livelihoods, etc.--exist not just as co-benefits, but as critical outcomes in their own right that can be measured, quantified, and paid for. Our vision for the Natural Capital Exchange is to expand beyond carbon to facilitate the trade of all of these valuable ecosystem services from forests.    The NCAPX platform has the ability to quantify these key co-benefits among others:    * Forest ecology    - Wildlife habitat and biodiversity (e.g. area preserved or suitability improved through forest treatment)  - Water quantity and quality (e.g. quantified through modeling and potentially measurable watershed-scale outcomes)    * Rural economic vitality    - Diverse livelihoods associated with rural lands (e.g. more foresters engaged in carbon projects instead of just extractive work)  - Small landowner and rural community profitability (e.g. availability of diverse/alternative value streams tied to forests, quantifiable as novel payments flowing into specific geographic areas)  ","There’s a widely-acknowledged risk that the transition to a low-carbon economy will be led by the segments of society that already benefit disproportionately from advances and investments in innovation and technology, leaving behind the rest. Equitable and inclusive forest carbon markets cut squarely against this risk, aligning rural communities with conservation and climate progress, and allowing them to share in the value created by climate regulation ‘technologies’ broadly defined, which have always included natural climate solutions.     In particular, small- and medium-size forest landowners have been almost entirely excluded from forest carbon markets, relegating over 200 million productive US forest acres to the climate sideline. By dramatically reducing transaction costs and reducing the carbon contract length to 1 year, NCAPX opens market participation to this entire segment, giving them access to carbon payments on equal terms with larger institutional landowners. In addition to diversifying small landowner income streams and offering payments for previously unrecognized value, annual carbon markets like NCAPX also de-risk family asset ownership by distributing return realization across many years, instead of concentrating it in infrequent, one-off harvesting events. This helps keep forests as forests and contributes to the economic base of rural communities. Through economic engagement, these communities can participate more constructively in the climate conversation and help develop climate solutions.   ",,,,,,,,

This is an Improved Forest Management voluntary carbon offset aggregation project that leverages the conservation power of accredited land trusts to permanently protect forests in northeastern USA. Aggregating multiple land trusts under one umbrella of the Initiative offers a streamlined, cost-effective way to make a difference for nature while doing what land trusts do best: saving places for future generations. All land trusts in the Initiative are accredited by the nationally-recognized Land Trust Alliance to ensure property owners are employing best practices and are well-established in their communities.  Recent peer-reviewed science demonstrates there is perhaps no better solution for combating climate change than permanent protection of wildlands. Credits generated in the Forever Wild Carbon Aggregation Initiative are the gold standard because the carbon storage impact is permanent. Only permanently protected wildlands can claim that carbon storage will continue in perpetuity. “Proforestation” is the act of permanently protecting existing forests so that they can sequester and store their full potential of carbon. By eliminating logging, virtually all of the carbon on those acres will stay in the wilderness, not in the atmosphere. Actively managed forestland or timberland credits do not guarantee that carbon won’t be released into the atmosphere during the term of the project or when the term has ended (usually after about 40 years). ‘Forever Wild’ forests, on the other hand, will never be converted to another type of land use (timber, agricultural, residential, or commercial), and will never release carbon through logging. Every forest that generates Forever Wild carbon credits is a future old-growth forest.  NEWT is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, SIG is a certified small business (California), and all revenue from the sale of CDRs generated by the Forever Wild Carbon Aggregation Initiative go right back into maintaining and expanding the initiative. Therefore, the Initiative will be self-funding, thereby reducing common financial barriers to land trusts. Managing multiple land trusts under one umbrella of the aggregation project reduces barriers to participation of landowners who possess high-quality forest carbon stocks, and the rolling enrollment permissions under the voluntary carbon offset program allow carbon in new forests to be permanently protected as they become available.","Montpelier","Vermont","USA",177975,40,10734,167241,"11/1/2020","All parcels enrolled the Forever Wild Carbon Aggregation Initiative will have forest management plans that specify monitoring requirements, which at a minimum include annual monitoring by both Northeast Wilderness Trust and the partnering land trust (required by Land Trust Alliance accreditation), inspection of key access points to properties, and maintenance of boundary markings.    The forest carbon project will be third-party verified and registered with the American Carbon Registry. Unintentional reversals- such as those from fire, floods, or pests-  are compensated for with the insurance buffer pool required by the Registry. The buffer pool represents 16% of total credits that acts as insurance to natural disturbances.    The Registry also requires compensation by the project proponent for intentional reversals. The Forever Wild Carbon Aggregation Initiative only includes lands that will be legally and permanently protected as ‘forever wild’ in a conservation easement. Thus, there is minimal risk of an intentional reversal. If by chance there is an intentional reversal, the project must replace the reversal credits with equivalent credits to the Registry. The Forever Wild conservation easements allow for redress from landowners for any violation of easement terms, including compensation for intentional carbon reversals such as those from human actions.    Lastly, because this aggregation carbon project would not disturb the soil or plant cover any more than results from occasional travel on foot, invasive plants rarely have the disturbance necessary to invade the well-developed ecosystems that exist in wilderness.

Protecting and creating new wilderness such as those in this aggregation carbon offset project are essential for wildlife and natural processes, and for maintaining biodiversity in the coming decades. Diverse, interconnected habitats are essential for species to evolve, move around, and occupy new habitats as the climate rapidly changes. Wildlands are remarkably effective at absorbing and storing carbon, while also offering species resilient, connected habitats and contiguous carbon corridors.   Forests such as those in this Initiative are also crucial to watershed conservation and water supply sustainability. Growing trees and the impervious surface of the forest floor mitigate stormwater run-off and erosion control, thereby providing flood protection for communities.   Additionally, establishing forever wild carbon areas, may also help change people’s fundamental view of their relationship with nature, replacing hubris with humility and personal interest with public service and climate action. Peer-reviewed science has showed that experiencing nature, such the forests in this Initiative, provides many health benefits for those who recreate outdoors, improving both physical and mental health. People who visit the Forever Wild carbon landscapes will understand the importance of wilderness, and will leave with a profound sense of self, a sense of their place in nature and human society, and a connectedness to, respect for, and compassion for nature and for their neighbors.    Aggregating multiple parcels under the umbrella of the Forever Wild Carbon Aggregation Initiative also reduces economic and administrative barriers for land trusts wishing to enroll in the carbon offset market by offering a stream-lined, cost-effective process. The rolling enrollment permissions under ACRs voluntary carbon offset program allow carbon in new forests to be permanently protected as they become available. All revenue generated from sale of CDRs will be used to cover costs associated with maintaining compliance with the voluntary IFM carbon offset credit protocol (with rolling admission), providing technical assistance and outreach to project partners, and ideally procuring new Wild Carbon lands and forging new partnerships to enroll in the project to expand protection and build contiguous carbon corridors. ","Spatial Informatics Group’s Diversity Mission: Advancing Science Requires Diversity  Spatial Informatics Group believe diversity and uniqueness drives innovation and advances science in a world with ever-changing environmental conditions. We strive to make a constant effort toward a path of equality in our workforce and landowners we work with in carbon offset markets. Ecosystems are healthy and thriving when they contain diversity – so are businesses and communities.   Specifically, Spatial Informatics Group has established partnerships with Native American Tribes that reinvest carbon revenue back into their communities. Carbon finances provide tribal jobs and improve rural livelihoods. These program goes beyond developing offsets, but also include building forest carbon technical capacity and mentoring Tribal youth as advisors in graduate school.    For Northeast Wilderness Trust, the concept of equal rights is at the very core of their mission. Northeast Wilderness Trust opposes all forms of prejudice and discrimination.  Although NEWTs work is largely directed to creating equality for nonhuman life, NEWT recognizes that all forms of oppression—from the destruction of forests to the persecution of the “Other” in human societies—are related, and that ultimately, we must work to end this oppression on all levels.    Northeast Wilderness Trust is dedicated to giving equal rights to wild nature and future generations, two constituencies often overlooked by the short-term politics of self-interest. NEWT is committed to promoting the common good: the whole of a community as opposed to parts of a community. Prejudice towards an idea, an organism, or a social group harms not only the parts but the whole community, and stands in the way of the public interest. The politics of prejudice, discrimination, and hatred have many forms, and must not be allowed to go unchallenged. Many of the NEWT’s Board, staff, and members commit time and energy to social issues. Northeast Wilderness Trust has a personnel policy prohibiting all forms of discrimination in hiring and the workplace. No one on the Board or staff would condone prejudicial or discriminatory behavior in or outside the workplace.",,,,,,,,

"The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit corporation","None","U.S. Working Forests for Climate Benefits ","U.S Working Forests for Climate Benefits 1: WI & NH ","None",,"In collaboration with AI for Earth grantees and in partnership with the Climate Innovation Fund, The Conservation Fund will deliver verifiable and additional carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to Microsoft through improved forest management and the permanent protection of critical forestland across the U.S. Furthermore, the partnership will demonstrate a new, technology-enabled and efficient model for nature-based climate solutions that will catalyze a rapid expansion of the nature-based climate solutions market.     The Conservation Fund has over a decade of experience protecting large and intact forests, implementing sustainable management for climate and ecosystem benefits, and generating forest carbon offsets. This proposal reflects a new approach that will accelerate the rate of forest protection, enable improved forest management at scale, and utilize technology to create new efficiencies for generating CDR. The potential for this project is to create a dedicated source of high-quality, nature-based CDR that Microsoft can draw from to cover its carbon removal needs. Beyond the immediate scope of this project, we anticipate multiple future projects with investment from the Climate Innovation Fund that can catalyze significantly more volume of CDR over the next 10 years.       We are including two properties in this project that are already under control of The Conservation Fund. A two-property approach allows for project diversification. The first property is 14,000 acres in Iron County, Wisconsin and the second is 8,800 acres in New Hampshire’s North Country.      To generate CDR, The Conservation Fund will implement a management program based on improved forest management. Specifically, we plan to reduce timber harvest levels by as much as 80% below the long-term sustained yield of the forest. This significant reduction of timber harvest will generate additional CDR. Conservation easements will ensure that there will be permanent protection and enforcement provisions aligned with the terms of this proposal. We are not accounting for the avoided emissions of the existing forest carbon stocks protected through forest conservation in our CDR offering.     Microsoft’s payment for CDR will defray the cost of foregoing timber harvest and will enable reinvestment in the forest for restoration, recreation, and infrastructure to promote inclusion and access. CDR payments are essential for maintaining working forests as viable economic entities and investable assets, driven by climate outcomes instead of timber harvests alone. Microsoft’s payment will establish a market precedent for real and verifiable carbon reductions that are scalable and will activate greater participation from the corporate and capital markets.

In the case of this project, there are a broad range of co-benefits and we have added mechanisms to ensure their permanent delivery. For example:     The project safeguards 22,800 acres of natural, climate-resilient forest. We have committed to this through permanent conservation easements that ensure neither property can be developed for non-forest uses. This safeguarding of natural forests is essential for so many benefits beyond climate.     Both properties protect important wetlands and are essential for the maintenance of water quality, help support native fish populations, and avoid the water withdrawals, impacts and conflicts that would be associated with future development.

The properties are open for public recreation, and actively used for hiking, hunting, wildlife viewing, fishing, and snowmobiling. In addition to the health benefits created by this recreational opportunity, recreation drives local economic activity in rural communities. Miles of trails and public access are provided on the project.     As part of our property selection process we prioritize the landscape conservation significance and a climate resilient landscape. Both properties adjoin large protected forest areas.","As a large landowner and employer in economically-distressed rural communities, The Conservation Fund has put to practice principles of just transition for close to three decades. Across our portfolio, we regularly work with local residents and leaders to facilitate community-led visioning that can drive an economic development strategy across sectors.        Already for the New Hampshire property we have worked with community leaders, local partners, and over 60 local businesses to help the economically-distressed and regionally-disempowered area of Coos County, NH to broaden its economic future and improve and grow local wealth by activating the outdoor recreation economy. This region has seized on the idea of maximizing outdoor recreation and place-based livelihoods in a way that substantially revives and revitalizes the region, giving residents a reason to stay, former residents a reason to return, and for new residents a reason to join the community. This work embodies the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion by relying on local expertise and capacity, transparency in communication, and supporting local leadership. The Conservation Fund serves the role as a facilitator and coach, inspiring and supporting new ideas for very old systemic issues. Currently, The Conservation Fund’s field staff is focused with five local leadership networks on ideas to address year-round employment, training and career pathways for youth, destination sales, recruitment and retention, and affordable housing.     Moving forward, our plan for this project is to support a ‘recover forward’ strategy across both regions into equitable, inclusive, and low-carbon economies. To achieve this objective, we are imposing a first-of-its-kind $2/ton community investment fee that would be directly injected into helping with a just transition. We will deploy these funds to build the critical infrastructure in both Coos County, NH and Iron County, WI.      A primary use of these funds will be to employ local individuals and businesses to use their skills, and in some cases their same heavy equipment used in forestry, to build trails, restore habitat, and develop the necessary infrastructure of the green economy. This community investment is a powerful job creator and is essential to building local wealth in these communities. Other anticipated avenues for community investment may include educational curriculum in nature, technology, and entrepreneurialism to local schools and summer internship opportunities for local youth. The impact of $2/ton over a 10 year program has the potential to generate over $1 million in each community.  ",,,,,,,,

These managed forests cover 23,000 acres in the globally-important Clinch River Valley. The Clinch River itself is recognized worldwide for its incredible diversity of rare freshwater mussels and fish. The mountains and valleys that surround the river are a core part of one of North America’s most critical migratory corridors for plants and animals adjusting to a warming climate. The Clinch Valley is part of   Virginia’s coal country: an economically-challenged region of Central Appalachia going through a profound change due to the industry’s decline. Without TNC’s Clinch Conservation Forestry Program these forests would be vulnerable to clear-cutting and degradation by landowners who depend on these forests for income.  The program’s climate-smart forest management not only increases carbon sequestration in the forests of enrolled properties, it also and provides a stable source of income for participating landowners. They receive an annual payment from TNC, and in exchange, TNC maintains full control over how their forest is managed. Microsoft’s purchase of carbon credits from the program will help to support these management activities and landowner payments.  The program is led by two professional foresters who are supported by an aquatic scientist and a landscape ecologist/wildlife specialist. The lead forester, Greg Meade, has deep experience in successfully developing and implementing forest carbon projects and has been the lead on these carbon projects since their inception, including several verifications.  In addition to carbon project management, the team oversees all forest restoration activities, which include planning and implementing carefully designed commercial timber harvests, controlling invasive species, conducting non-commercial timber stand improvement practices, completing forest inventories and other ecological monitoring, leading field tours with other forestry professionals, and establishing exclusion fencing to protect sensitive caves and other native wildlife habitats from nearby livestock.  The team also maintains our program’s third-party certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (https://us.fsc.org/en-us).  Every enrolled property has permanent legal protection via conservation easement (or, in one case, The Nature Conservancy’s fee simple ownership). Additionally, our registration as a certified forest carbon offset project (under the guidelines of the California Air Resources Board) requires a 100-year commitment to sustainable forest management.

Furthermore, sites chosen for participation in the program are strategically located in the watershed of the globally-important Clinch River System—one of the most biodiverse rivers in North America harboring one of the highest concentrations of rare aquatic species on the continent. Our program seeks out landowners whose properties contain forests and streams that have a significant influence on water quality in the greater Clinch River system.   Therefore, our sustainable management practices on properties enrolled in our program do not just help to sequester carbon, but they also restore forest health and benefit globally rare species downstream.      Our efforts at protecting and improving the quality of water flowing from the forested properties that we manage into in the receiving Clinch River also has a direct benefit to the health of human communities who draw their drinking water from the Clinch.  And our maintenance of forest health and of water quality supports a growing regional tourism industry that is focused on the Clinch and its recreational potential for fishing, canoeing, and other outdoor activities.        The Clinch River System is also at the heart of the Appalachians, which has outsized importance for conserving biodiversity and stabilizing our climate. The Appalachians are home to some of the largest, most ecological diverse temperate forests on Earth and form one of North America’s most critical migratory corridors by which plants and animals adjust to warming temperatures. Already scientists see plants and animals shifting an average of 11 miles north and 30 feet up in elevation per decade. The portion of the Appalachians at the juncture of Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, where this program operates, harbors the greatest amount of biodiversity in the lower 48 states, a fact attributable to both geology and isolation. Preserving forests here—and especially returning these forests to health—will both store greater amounts of carbon and preserve more plants and animals.  ","The counties located in the Clinch Valley are some of the most economically challenged areas in Virginia and the broader eastern United States. According to the Appalachian Regional Commission, which classifies counties in Appalachia based on a mix of income, poverty, and unemployment statistics, most counties in the Clinch Valley are either considered “at-risk” or “distressed” (https://www.arc.gov/research/MapsofAppalachia.asp?MAP_ID=137). Operating in this context, The Nature Conservancy has worked to develop conservation programs in the Clinch Valley that benefit nature but also meet the needs of people. By helping to maintain sustainable working forests, the Clinch Valley Conservation Forestry program represents an important bridge strategy that focuses simultaneously on restoring forest health and providing economic opportunities to local people.  Our Conservation Forestry Program evolved out of the need to balance conservation with the need of local landowners to generate income in an economically distressed region. For many of these landowners, their forests have evolved into savings accounts that they harvest every 30 years to meet a major family need: to help send a child to college or meet a medical emergency. Even landowners who wish to retain their woods get drawn into this boom-and-bust approach to forest management out of economic need. TNC’s program provides them with an alternative that is beneficial to their income and the health of the forest.    The success of this program has inspired other, community-based efforts, within The Nature Conservancy and, more specifically, within this region of Appalachia. TNC’s Clinch Valley Program has been operating in Southwestern Virginia since 1989. These deep roots have allowed us to witness the economic challenges of living here and to seek ways of marrying conservation and economic well-being. For instance, TNC’s Clinch Valley Program has been a leader in a grassroots-initiated effort to create a state park on Clinch River—both to create an incentive for communities along its route to protect this river and to spur conservation-compatible economic development. The park is now within a couple of years of opening. Already, communities have witnessed significant climbs in tourism and tourism-related industries. Although the pandemic has curtailed these activities, it has not squashed them, which is an encouraging sign for these communities.   TNC is also advocating for siting solar energy on previously coal-mined lands. With coal mining in permanent decline here, solar power offers a means of putting this land to good use, generating well-paying jobs, and encouraging clean energy that is truly green.

"The Nature Conservancy","The Family Forest Carbon Program is a partnership between The Nature Conservancy, The American Forest Foundation, and the Family Forest Impact Foundation.    The American Forest Foundation (AFF) is a conservation impact non-profit dedicated to the sustainability of America’s family-owned forests.  AFF works with more than 80,000 landowners across the country, promoting sustainable forest management that promotes a broad array of forest values, including but not limited to carbon storage and sequestration, clean air, clean water, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and strong rural economies.  Within the FFCP, they are responsible for the design and implementation of our landowner engagement efforts.  They also collaborate with TNC on stakeholder, customer and investor engagement.  The Family Forest Impact Foundation (FFIF) is a subsidiary organization of AFF.   Its role is to hold the contracts with landowners, with investors, and with the buyers of the credits produced by the program.  In many cases, FFIF will have a contract with TNC for the credits produced by the program, and TNC will have a contract with the ultimate credit buyer.  Currently the Conservancy does not have commitments from FFIF it identifies in this proposal. The Conservancy would need to secure such commitments before it can make a binding commitment or execute a legal agreement. For this proposal in response to the RFP, the Conservancy must secure all of its internal management approvals before it can make a binding commitment or execute a legal agreement.","Bringing family-owned forests off the sidelines in the climate fight","Family Forest Carbon Program","https://www.familyforestcarbon.org/",,"The Family Forest Carbon Program is a collaboration between The Nature Conservancy and the American Forest Foundation to engage America’s family-owned forests in the struggle against climate change.  Because families and individuals own the largest share of our nation’s forests, the engagement of these landowners is necessary to activate our largest potential Natural Climate Solution, which is enhanced storage and sequestration of carbon in forests. Historically, these landowners have been unable to participate in carbon markets because of the high transaction costs of traditional forest carbon projects. TNC and AFF have collaborated on the design of a new methodology under Verra’s Voluntary Carbon Standard that is practice-based, meaning that landowners are compensated for the implementation of a specific management practice.  Currently the program offers landowners in the Central Appalachians two options:  1) Growing Mature Forests, under which we provide funding to limit (but not eliminate) timber harvests and let trees grow large for 20 years; and 2) Enhancing Future Forests, which provides funding to remove invasive or other competing plants that prevent trees from growing.  Additional practices are under development for both the Central Appalachians and other forested regions of the country.  The program aims to recruit approximately 7,000 landowners and 500,000 acres within the Central Appalachians over the next 5-7 years, while also launching similar efforts in other regions.  Because family landowners own such a large portion of America’s forests, the mitigation opportunity is immense if we can reach an appropriate scale:  approximately 2 gigatons between now and 2100, assuming we can enroll roughly 20% of the eligible land base by 2030.      The program delivers CDR by incentivizing landowners to manage their forests in a way that accelerates carbon sequestration.  In Growing Mature Forests, larger, faster-growing trees are maintained on the landscape, which leads to additional sequestration.  In Enhancing Future Forests, the removal of competition leads to increased growth and sequestration.  The majority of payments from Microsoft for CDR would go to the landowner, while the minority would go to cover program costs such as landowner engagement, technical assistance for landowners, monitoring, program administration, and program finance costs.      Within the partnership, TNC leads the science and methodological work, along with the engagement of corporate partners and external stakeholders.  AFF leads the design and implementation of landowner engagement efforts.  Both organizations collaborate closely on all aspects of the program.  ","Philadelphia","PA","USA",1400000,51,0,1400000,"8/3/2020","Because we will produce credits certified under the Voluntary Carbon Standard, our credits will be monitored and reversals reported overa 100 year timeframe, consistent with VCS protocol. VCS’ approach to permanence involves a risk-assessment, where credits are purposefully reserved to address reversals and other permanence issues. Our program will incorporate this risk-assessment approach, but will go further to address durability.    The Family Forest Carbon Program monitors permanence at the program level, not the property level. This allows us to pursue several strategies for ensuring the permanence of our carbon benefits across the program.    First and most importantly, our practices are designed to be self-sustaining after the initial contractual period. We are financing a forest landowner’s transition to more sustainable forest management practices. Just as a farmer transitioning to organic practices incurs lost revenue during the transition, but ultimately emerges from the transition with a more profitable management regime, so too landowners who adopt our practices will experience an initial opportunity cost (addressed through an incentive payment to the landowner), followed by a positive return on investment after the contract period. Sustainable forestry practices produce more timber, and thus more timber value, in the long-run, than business-as-usual practices. Because of this, reversals after the contract period would not be in the financial interest of the landowner, and we can therefore expect them to be infrequent.    However, we can foresee potential market events (such as a spike in the prices for high-quality hardwoods) that might induce some reversals among “alumni” of the FFCP. To address this risk, we will pursue a mixture of the following strategies:    1)	We will seek to reenroll landowners in subsequent FFCP contracts whenever possible.  2)	We will use remote sensing to monitor reversals on properties that were enrolled in FFCP to quantify the amount of reversals and their carbon impact.   3)	We will recruit additional landowners to replace the lost carbon benefits the program has procured. Our financial model includes setting aside a portion of the profit margin from the program in a “permanence fund” to finance such replacements. Eventually, we may replace carbon lost from reversals with carbon removals from other projects or even other sectors.   4)	We will pursue conversations with insurers and re-insurers about innovative new insurance products, such as parametric assurance, that would align insurance payments with key events correlated with reversals (such as a spike in timber prices).     These strategies, combined with the pre-existing assurances offered by the VCS buffer pool, allow buyers to be confident in the 100-year durability of the credits offered by the program. ","No","No, the project will not be certified by June 2021 (please specify)","While we will receive approval for a new methodology under Verra’s Voluntary Carbon Standard by June 2021, we do not anticipate that any particular project will have completed verification under that new methodology by June 2021.",,,"Verra (VCS)",,,,,,"The Family Forest Carbon Program provides incentive payments to landowners to adopt more sustainable forest management practices, in line with the best available science on silviculture. Our practices will produce not only carbon, but additional benefits, including the improvement of habitat for at-risk species, and the support for rural economies. The only potential negative impact we have identified is a short-term reduction in the amount of timber available to the local hardwood sawmill industry. But this impact will be short-lived, as the adoption of FFCP practices at scale will increase over time the total timber volumes available to wood processing industries, for the same reason that it will increase carbon on the landscape: because better forest management leads to more productivity and volume.  To avoid any potential negative impacts, our practices sharply limit and proscribe the type and method of timber harvesting that can be practiced.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","The Family Forest Carbon Program will produce several important co-benefits.  We have completed a preliminary exercise mapping those co-benefits against the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Currently, none of our co-benefits are certified by a third-party standard (such as SD Vista).  However, we have applied for funding to pursue SD Vista verified biodiversity claims.    Biodiversity / SDG 15, Life on Land  We have partnered with the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), and specifically with the various organizations involved in the Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture (AJV) to model the population effects of our forest management practices on at-risk bird species, including the Cerulean and Golden-winged warblers.  Initial results of the modeling suggest, for example, that the program’s impacts will support an additional 316 Golden-winged warblers.  We have plans to pursue SD Vista verification on our biodiversity claims within the next 2-3 years, once the results of our joint research with AJV is complete.     Water Quality / SDGs 6, Clean Water and Sanitation, and 14, Life Below Water  We have completed a thorough literature review on the links between our specific management practices and water quality.  We can qualitatively assert water quality benefits that accrue both to municipal water users and to marine resources (particularly the Chesapeake Bay).  Specific quantification is extremely difficult and costly due to the hyper-local nature of water quality impacts, and we are unlikely to pursue it for that reason.      Sustainable Production of Timber Resources / SDG 12, Responsible Consumption and Production; and SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities  We model the amount of additional board feet available for local timber production as a result of the program.  For the Central Appalachians, our initial project would create an additional 250 million board feet of sustainably managed timber. This amount can be verified alongside carbon verification.       Enhanced Rural Livelihoods / SDG 1, No Poverty, and SDG 10, Reduced Inequalities  The Central Appalachians region is one of the poorer regions of the country, with the median household income across the region only 80% of the national average.  Family woodland owners are often “land rich, cash poor,” with one third of them having household median incomes of under $50,000.  The program will support rural economies in the area in two ways:  first, directly, through the provision of incentive payments to landowners; and second, indirectly, through long-term support of the wood products industry in the region.  We have modeled both outcomes based on our current assumptions, and have found that the project will provide approximately $130 million in payments to Central Appalachian landowners.  In addition, our model projects the additional timber resources generated through the program will support approximately 40 jobs in wood processing and manufacturing industries. To monitor the economic outcomes for landowners, we will first maintain precise records on total incentive payments made to landowners throughout the project region.  We will utilize observed timber prices to estimate the impacts of the program upon the Net Present Value of the timber resource of landowners at a landscape scale.  Finally, we will engage in case studies of 5-10 participating landowners to determine how the implementation of the program had impacted the Net Present Value of their timber resource.  We do not anticipate making specific claims associated with these co-benefits but we do intend to track these outcomes for the purposes of making sure the program design aligns economic and environmental incentives, because such alignment is the best mechanism to assure the durability of the carbon impact (see above).    Climate Partnerships / SDG 17, Partnerships for the Goals  The program represents a unique partnership between landowners, corporations, investors, federal and state agencies, local and national conservation groups, and actors within the forest products industry (foresters and loggers).  ","Traditionally, the demographic we are trying to involve in the production of CDR credits has been shut out of climate finance in general and carbon markets specifically.  To date, even though this ownership group (family forest owners with less than 1,000 acres) represents over 80% of family-owned land in the U.S., they only account for less than 1% of the current carbon projects.  The reason is the high transaction costs associated with project development under existing IFM methodologies.  A variety of groups have tried to address this challenge in two basic ways:  one group has tried to use legal aggregation methods and improved use of technology to fit family projects inside of existing methodologies.  Another group has embraced a new carbon accounting principle that would allow for families to be engaged more efficiently combined with innovations in remote sensing and other technology solutions.  The first approach has resulted in a few successful projects, but no reasonable way to scale those approaches to meet the climate demand.  The second approach, though intriguing, is unlikely to satisfy the well-defined and well-defended scientific consensus around forest carbon accounting, and lead to claims that are unlikely to withstand skepticism.    The FFCP took a third approach.  We designed a new methodology, fully consistent with existing forest carbon standards, that specifically addressed the challenges family owners faced in accessing carbon markets.  We have attached the methodology we developed under VCS guidance as a reference to this proposal.  The methodology contains two key innovations that address barriers to family forests entering carbon markets:    First, in contrast to traditional IFM projects, our methodology measures the change in stocks following the implementation of an observed treatment or practice, not initial stocking inventories. This subtle change in our approach to monitoring allows us to monitor stock change on a statistically significant sample of participating properties, rather than on every property—while still confirming that every enrolled property is implementing appropriately.  We report on carbon benefit at the landscape level.  This allows us to spread out the costs of our robust monitoring program across many participating properties.    Second, stock changes are measured on “treated” project plots and compared to an observed baseline.  The baseline is monitored through matched control plots–achieved by weighting a composite of similar FIA plots. The delta between the project and baseline plots equals the carbon benefit that can then be verified and eventually monetized.  The accounting does not rely on long-term growth and yield modeling of anticipated baseline performance; instead, baselines are updated with every MRV cycle with updated FIA data to capture changes in large scale forest ecosystem, policy and market dynamics.  This approach addresses one of the major concerns of the marketplace in regard to IFM projects, which is the accuracy of the baseline and the system-gaming that can occur when that baseline is set.  Our baseline is something that can be observed and remeasured over time – it exists in the actual physical universe.  Credit buyers can have increased confidence that the resulting carbon credits represent real reductions in atmospheric CO2.",,,,,,,,

In the last 5 years, the Pennsylvania TNC Program has effectively achieved land conservation numbers greater than what was accomplished in the last 50 years at 10% of traditional land conservation costs.   The results were achieved by targeting key landowner segments with a value proposition that includes forest protection in the form of working forest easements and conservation agreements, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification and access to carbon markets.  The Working Woodlands model can help landowners achieve higher performing forests, with better growth rates that produce higher value wood products. The forest carbon benefits involve improving forest practices to promote healthy and resilient forests that sequester more carbon than current practices.  The additional carbon is quantified, verified and sold to organizations or companies that wish to offset their carbon footprint.      To date, 17 projects on 125,000 acres have been protected in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, Tennessee, and Vermont.  Over 5,000 acres have received forest restoration treatments, and over 3.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) will be sequestered over the life of the projects.  Now, the model is expanding across the US.      Our priority areas for Working Woodlands expansion are across the Nature Conservancy’s Resilient and Connected lands network which includes areas of the Northeast, Upper-mid-west, South and Pacific Northwest with an emphasis on the Central Appalachian region, which includes Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.  This region includes some of the most economically depressed parts of the country encompassing six of the ten poorest counties in the US. The Central Appalachians, long isolated from markets, and heavily dependent on a declining coal industry, are experiencing significant economic disruption, with unemployment in many areas ranging from 25-40%. However, the extensive forests of this region, among the most biodiverse temperate forests on Earth, include millions of acres of family forests.

Participating landowners – who otherwise would not have enrolled in USDA subsidy programs absent the additional incentive from carbon finance – agree to enroll in the USDA Farm Bill Wetland Reserve Easement (30-year) or Conservation Reserve (10 or 15 years) programs. The Nature Conservancy, using private funding, secures permanent easements on the land and provides all site preparation, tree planting, and monitoring.  Essentially, TNC “stacks” and leverages private investments with public funding (via the USDA farm Bill). TNC also establishes an easement endowment, conducts monitoring for compliance and carbon, and facilitates the verification of carbon offsets on behalf of private funders. The initial suite of instances (11) has a crediting period of 32 years.     LMVGAP will achieve GHG removals by planting trees that sequester atmospheric CO2 in live aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, and soil. The project activity involves cessation of previous agricultural activities, followed by implementation of site preparation and tree planting technologies that have been in use for decades in the region.    LMVGAP was validated in 2012 and includes the Mississippi delta regions of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  Following an intensive regulatory review by both USDA and TNC, 1,471 acres were put under easement during the Proof of Concept phase. Over 1,100 acres were reforested with bottomland hardwood tree species.  Average easement acquisition cost was ~$600/acre and site preparation/tree planting costs averaged $324/acre. Also, private investment dollars were leveraged 1:2 with USDA funds for easement acquisitions.       Microsoft funds will be used to support landowner outreach, secure permanent easements on enrolled LMVGAP tracts, site preparation and tree planting, monitoring for compliance, tree growth, and carbon and project verification events.

This approach is summarized as follows:     After issuance of carbon credits to a farmer, the farmer is obliged to report operating data for 10 years and to have this data independently verified at least once every three years. If a reversal is detected over the 10 year retention period, replacement credits will be acquired and retired by Nori. Nori also has a binding obligation to buy and retire new credits if a post- 10-year term audit finds that Nori over-credited a project,  If an audit finds that Nori under-credited a project, Nori issues supplemental credits to the farmer.    These procedures operationalize Nori's commitment to buyers that the underlying value of every credit they purchase is one incremental tonne CO2e removed from the atmosphere and retained in the natural system for a minimum of 10 years. Nori has allocated 20% of the 500 million carbon credit supply to an ""insurance reserve"" to back up this commitment, recognizing that some over-crediting that Nori will be required to cover under this commitment will be due to factors beyond the control of the farmers, and, therefore, covered by the force majeure provision in Nori's contract with farmers.

For this proposed project we use Nori’s method and focus on a life cycle analysis bounded by the physical project boundaries (i.e. changes in soil carbon dioxide sequestration that happen in the farm field).      [c]: This boundary does not include two sources of emissions: 1) changes in fuel use or embedded energy in inputs associated with farming activities and 2) Nitrous oxide emissions from the soil.     [d]: These sources of emissions are not included because they remain on average consistent across conventional and regenerative agricultural practices - so the main differences in emission balance from these systems is the difference in soil sequestration of carbon dioxide.     [e]: For nitrous oxide, we expect emissions to be constant or declining under regenerative practices, so the volume is 0 (or negative). For cover crop and no-till adoption we estimate an additional 40-50 lbs CO2e/ac in additional emissions if embedded energy and associated field tasks are taken into account minus fuel savings of around 50 lbs CO2e/ac (if assuming removing fall and spring tillage passes). Case studies commonly document reductions in crop protection and herbicides, which would reduce emissions further.     As always, we welcome feedback from the Microsoft team on this point to clarify or support these positions, or opportunities to collaborate in order to improve these estimates to serve ecosystem service markets.   "," For this proposed project we use Nori’s U.S. Croplands Methodology protocol. Third-party verifiers are accredited by Nori to provide independent attestations that reported practices are indeed conducted (which parameterize the COMET-Farm model for a given project). Also, at this time, only verifiers who are listed as approved and in good standing by the Verra, ACR, CAR and CARB offset credit registries are approved to provide verification services to Nori farmers. Farms undergo this verification step anywhere from every 1-3 years of the term of the project.     We welcome collaboration with Microsoft to ensure net negativity estimates are provided at required levels of precision and sufficiently reviewed by independent third parties.   ","There are many reasons to purchase carbon removals from nature-based solutions, but there are some challenges at both the field and landscape-level. Sequestering carbon by adopting regenerative agricultural practices is commonly done by growing cover crops and reducing (or eliminating) tillage. We provide more details in the attachment, but broadly the embedded energy costs associated with these field activities may add anywhere from 5-50lbs CO2e/ac depending on exact management practices and environmental tradeoffs may occur depending on changes in pest populations and pressures.      Landscape-scale concerns center around the possibility that regenerative agricultural practices will cause declines in crop yield, resulting in the expansion of farmland acreage and affecting overall food prices. We address these in turn.     With respect to these concerns, the proposed program’s potential harms are limited by two factors. First, limited evidence of crop yield declines (Pittlekow, 2015) means that any price differences resulting from the program would likely be small. Second, the crops most affected by the program generally go to feed animals, to industrial uses, or ethanol (less than 20% of the grain crop goes directly to human consumption). Even for the small amount of these crops that are directly consumed, the consumer impact of higher farm-gate prices is small (see USDA’s estimates of price-spread for a percentage of consumer price a farmer receives).     A knock-on effect from potential increased food prices focus is that increased prices encourage farmers to increase acreages. We want to emphasize that in U.S. croplands we have a low risk of domestic leakage. Since 1997 croplands in the U.S. have declined about 1% on average across the period 1997-2017 (USDA Quickstats: 445,324,765 acres in 1997 to 396,433,817 in 2017) while adoption of regenerative practices has markedly increased (see USDA AgCensus 2017 and 2012). The U.S. also has specific disincentives to convert native habitat. These include both sodsavers and swamp-buster provisions, which result in farmers being disqualified for FSA programs if they convert habitat to farmland.

","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Not applicable","Yes","Farms adopting regenerative practices of cover crops and reduced and/or no-till have been shown in peer-reviewed literature to have several co-benefits including soil erosion protection, improved water stewardship and quality, soil biodiversity, reduced erosion, lower applications of fertilizer, and crop protection inputs (i.e. pesticides and herbicides).  Cover crops may also reduce water runoff, which is an important factor in mitigation for flood hazards. Additionally, improving carbon levels in the soil has been shown to provide additional benefits in improving water holding capacity of cropland soils, making crops (and yields) more resilient to drought and improving nutrient cycling - reducing the need for additional synthetic nitrogen (as mentioned above), which in turn improves water quality.  ","The vast majority of farmers in North America are family-owned small businesses that are integral to the success of small rural communities. Many of these communities are low-income and underserved in many ways including access to technology (e.g. broadband) and STEM educational programs. Our customer farms, distributor partners along with Corteva are critical in providing employment and support to these under-resourced communities and the additional revenue from this carbon removal project will be beneficial to further bolster initiatives and increase employment. Additionally, agriculture has had formidable barriers to participate in carbon markets as the current markets are not designed to include carbon removal projects that are small in size. This opportunity for Corteva to aggregate into a larger project is enabling small businesses to participate in a market previously reserved for large corporations. ",,,,,,,,

The main objectives of the project are twofold: 1) to sustainably increase smallholder farmer agricultural productivity, income and welfare; and 2) to reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation, and increase net forest cover. Hence, the project comprises two components:    1. Sustainable Agricultural Land Management (SALM) component – which aims to promote widespread adoption of agricultural practices including conservation agriculture that increase food production per unit area and farmers’ income. The project promotes the adoption by farmers of legume-based alley cropping, residues management, and reduced tillage, among others.  The activities fall under the category “Agricultural Land Management (ALM) according to the VCS AFOLU Requirements v3.4, 2013. Eligible ALM activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions on cropland and grassland by increasing carbon stocks in soils and woody biomass and/or decreasing CO2, N2O and/or CH4 emissions from soils.  The project focuses on the following practices:  a) increase soil carbon stocks by increasing field residue inputs to soils and/or reducing soil carbon mineralization rates, and introduction of agroforestry practices.  b) reduce N2O emissions by improved fertilizer management through reduction in total nitrogen additions by substitution with compost manure, timely application and improved placement.    2. REDD+ component – which aims to reduce forest loss, and protect and expand areas under natural forest, and conserve biodiversity. This is achieved primarily through land use planning and creation of Community Conservation Areas (CCA).     The project area is divided into Chiefdoms which are under customary land tenure system and is shared by small scale farmers. Prior to the project, poor farming practices such as residue burning led to rapid soil nutrient depletion. There was also a general lack of land use planning and forest management, which led to destruction and fragmentation of the forests. The CLMP uses market incentives to promote adoption of SALM practices and forest conservation. It uses land use planning with traditional leaders and communities to identify zone areas for conservation and forest management known as CCA. These activities result in increased and sustainable agricultural production, and forest conservation. GHG emission reductions will be generated through improved carbon storage on farms. The revenues from the sale of carbon credits are shared between COMACO (35%), the communities (55%) and the Forestry Department (10%).
